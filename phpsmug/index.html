<p>phpSmug is an <a href="http://www.dgrin.com/showthread.php?t=82458">award winning</a> PHP wrapper class for the <a href="http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/API">SmugMug API</a>.  The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the SmugMug API in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.</p>
<p>phpSmug is written for PHP 4 and PHP 5, however PHP 4 support will be withdrawn at the end of the year when PHP 4 officially reaches the end of life, announced <a href="http://uk.php.net/#2007-07-13-1">here</a>.</p>
<p>phpSmug is based on the great work of Dan Coulter in phpFlickr.</p>
<p>The intention is to have two concurrently running versions of phpSmug - one for each version of the API versions SmugMug is currently supporting, and will be versioned based on the last digit of the underlying API. At the moment, SmugMug are offering <a href="http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/1.2.0">1.2.0</a> (Stable) and <a href="http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/1.2.1">1.2.1</a> (Beta)</p>
<h3>phpSmug 1.0.x (Stable)</h3>
<p>This branch of phpSmug implements the full functionality of version <a href="http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/1.2.0">1.2.0</a> of the SmugMug API.<br />
All of the 1.2.0 API methods have been implemented in phpSmug 1.0.x so this branch should be considered stable and feature complete.</p>

<h3>phpSmug 1.1.x (Beta)</h3>
<p>This branch of phpSmug implements the functionality of version <a href="http://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/1.2.1">1.2.1</a> of the SmugMug API.</p>
<div class="alert">
<strong />
<div class="center">WARNING - WARNING</div>
<p>The phpSmug 1.1.x branch is still under heavy development as the SmugMug API 1.2.1 is still under development and changing all the time.</p>
<p>ONLY those methods detailed at <a href="http://dgrin.com/showthread.php?t=71887">http://dgrin.com/showthread.php?t=71887</a> have been officially implemented and deemed to work.</p>
<p>If you need something stable, please consider the phpSmug 1.0.x revisions.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, due to memory constraints on my host, I've had to disable Trac - it's chewing up far too much of my memory allowance.  If you encounter any problems, please report them on the phpSmug announcement discussion on <a href="http://www.dgrin.com">Dgrin</a>.</p>
