<p>I am missing the access to the patch reports, e.g. 10_patch_report. Until June 2011, these were available under https://getupdates.oracle.com/reports/10_patch_report etc. but since then we get 404 errors. These reports appear still in CHECKSUMS and I wonder where they have been moved to.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and best regards, Andreas.</p>

<p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>The MOS 5.3 release in early July 2011 saw the completion of the transition of the back-end infrastructure for Oracle Sun patches from the old Sun infrastructure to the Oracle ARU/MOS infrastructure.</p>
<p>Therefore, some old Sun links disappeared. This was deliberate. Please use the MOS search features instead. Please see my previous blog postings for tips and details.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
