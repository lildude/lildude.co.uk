<p>We haven't implemented this into Solaris yet, however they should be able to compile this PAM module on Solaris with relative ease.</p>
<p>There is a method of doing this natively on Solaris and it takes advantage of autmount.  See the workaround in CR 6211761 (an RFE requesting pam_mkhomedir for Solaris) for details.</p>
