<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/01/digital-economy-act-will-fail">Why the Digital Economy Act simply won't work</a> - I think Cory Doctorow sums it up beautifully at the end... "Once you swallow a spider to catch a fly, you're on a course to swallow a bird to catch the spider, a cat to catch the bird, and so on until you swallow a horse – and every toddler knows that happens next."</li>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/370157/">LCA: How to destroy your community [LWN.net]</a> - Oh how true.</li>
<li><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/suns-lost-intel-chip-killer/">Sun’s Lost Intel-Chip Killer - Bits Blog - NYTimes.com</a> - So that's why Sun bought Montalvo.  Somehow I don't think Sun would have been able to make the return on these had they come to market, but nice to know Sun's untold ambitions are coming to light.</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/translation_iphone_4">Daring Fireball: Translation From Apple's Unique Dialect of PR-Speak to English of the 'Letter From Apple Regarding iPhone 4'</a> - A great "translation" of Apple's letter concerning the iPhone 4's signal problems.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1134">OGB Threatens to Shoot Itself In The Head</a> - I agree with Ben here; the OGB are being a bit childish here and if they go ahead they'll do more damage than good.  It's not as if the OGB has actually done anything beneficial - if they have I certainly can't point it out.</li>
