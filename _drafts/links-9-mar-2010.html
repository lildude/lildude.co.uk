<p>Links of interest for 9 Mar 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/what-expect-html5-611">What to expect from HTML5</a> - I'm looking forward to the HTML5 standard being finally ratified and completely supported by all the major browsers.  I'm slowly moving all my sites across to using HTML5, but can't just in whole-hog yet as not all browsers support some of the functionality I want to use.  Lets hope they ratify this quicker than XHTML2 (what's that?)</li>
</ul>
