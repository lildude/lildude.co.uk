I've just finished my first pair programming session and I'm really surprised how useful it was and how well it went. With the help of [ScreenHero](https://screenhero.com/) my mentor - who I might add is in the US :us: whilst I'm in the UK :gb: - was instantly seeing my code and pointing me in the right direction and teaching me new things in no time at all.

This is much quicker and easier than fumbling around, experimenting and using something like Slack or waiting for feedback on pull requests.

This is definitely something I'll be keeping in my growing "I'm a software developer" toolbox.
