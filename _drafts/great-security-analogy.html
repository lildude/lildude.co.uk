<p>> The question is: what more does the customer need?</p>
<p>A can of security spray, which, when applied liberally,<br />
leaves everyone involved with a comfortable level of <abbr title="cover your arse">CYA</abbr>.<br />
Actually reading a document and taking action involves<br />
an uncomfortable level of free will for which someone<br />
could be blamed later on; a script removes any need<br />
to think and thus any chance of being blamed when things<br />
go wrong. </p>
