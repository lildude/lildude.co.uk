<p>As we move towards the official release of Solaris 11 later this year, one question may come to mind:  What is the difference between Solaris 11 Express and the full Solaris 11 release when it is released?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Customers on an existing support plan (Oracle Premier Support or Oracle Solaris Premier Subscription) will be transitioned over to Oracle Solaris 11 when it is available. They will use the new packaging tools (IPS and ZFS boot environments) and it should be a seamless transition.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Solaris 11 Express is only supported until the next release comes out - i.e.<br />
a 1 year lifecycle instead of 10 years.</p>
<p>Also in terms of interface stability, Solaris 11 Express is not considered fully<br />
set yet - we will be making incompatible changes still, unlike the usual<br />
guarantee that if your application or hardware is supported/certified for S10U*<br />
it should just run on any later S10 Update release as well.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Oracle Solaris 11 Express provides access to advanced Oracle Solaris features that have been in development for more than five years. It allows customers to deploy the latest Oracle Solaris features today while preparing their environments to take advantage of Oracle Solaris 11. See the press <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/187136" target="_blank">release</a> for further announcement details.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>"Express" in this instance does not mean what it does with some other products.</p>
<p>Oracle Solaris 11 Express is a release being offered ahead of the initial Oracle Solaris 11 release, coming later this year.  It's not a "lite" release being sold side by side with a full release; it's considered a production release of Oracle Solaris, with the same licensing and support options as Oracle Solaris 10 and the upcoming Oracle Solaris 11 release.  This gives customers and partners the opportunity to start deployment and testing now, rather than waiting.</p>
<p>That being said, there are additional features we're still working on that we plan to integrate into the initial release; we don't have a public list of what those features will be.  We also may (as in "most likely will") be deprecating support for some older systems that are currently supported in Oracle Solaris 11 Express. </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Solaris 11 Express is NOT a "release candidate".  It is a fully supported member of the Oracle Solaris family of OS's. Solaris 11 Express has 2+ years maturity in the ZFS Storage Appliance. Also, Solaris 11 Express is a fully supported OS choice for Exalogic.</p>
<p>Solaris 11, to be released later this year, will include new features not available in Solaris 11 Express. </p>
