<p>So GitHub has these Ã¼ber comfy little cubby holes on the 1st floor (they call it the second, but I'm a geek so count floors from 0 ;-) ) called coder caves.  They are incredibly comfy, quiet, private and just a great place to go and hack code without any distractions.  Well, imagine my surprise when I encountered this today...</p>
<p>Yes, probably the only ex-Oracle employee at GitHub has just stumbled upon an Oracle blanket!!!</p>
