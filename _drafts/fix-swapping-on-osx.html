<p>Using the details at http://dropsafe.crypticide.com/article/3848</p>
<p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>1.  I use time machine for backups, but to make it bootable I needed to make my Time Machine disk bootable (it makes it easier than having to dig up the DVD when things go wrong.  To do this, I followed details at http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2008011623365026</p>
<p>2.  Once I've got my bootable time machine (tested and confirmed it works), I repartitioned using the Disk Utility using these details - http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1395749</p>
