<p>When an app core is created in a ngz, coreadm from the zone and global pick it up making 2 core files. It seems that this is to be expected looking at the note at the end of the coreadm man page and there is a workaround procedure in a coreadm doc.</p>
<p>http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23823_01/html/817-0403/tscore-7.html</p>
<p>--- man page ---<br />
When a process is dumping core, up to three core files can be produced: one in the per-process location, one in the system-wide global location, and, if the process was running in a local (non-global) zone, one in the global location for the zone in which that process was running. Each core file is generated according to the effective options for the corresponding location.<br />

<p>"coreadm -d global" doesn't work quite right it prevents all core file from that zone (global) from being created too.</p>
<p>An RFE will be created for this, but in the mean time this can be easily done as follows:</p>
<p>globalzone# /var/cores/%z/core.%f@%t.%p<br />
globalzone# mkdir /var/cores/global/</p>
<p>Because the only zonename directory that exists in the global zone is /var/cores/global that means you won't get cores written in /var/cores in the global zone for processes from a non global zone.</p>
