Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Colin, welcome to my little technical corner of the internet where I ramble on about tech stuffs that interest me.

When I'm not rambling here, I'm rambling about running, cycling, rowing, swimming and all other sporty stuff at [gonefora.run](https://gonefora.run) and everything else at [colinseymour.co.uk](https://colinseymour.co.uk).

During the day I'm a senior software engineer at GitHub and consider myself a jack of all trades (it's a [good thing](https://tim.blog/2007/09/14/the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades/)), ie a bit of a [generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Generalist), with a penchant for solving hard problems. I'm also the lead maintainer of [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist), the logic behind GitHub's language detection. 

When not working or exercising, I drink great beers, eat amazing food and tinker on software projects in a variety of languages.

You can find out more about me in the about pages of my other two sites.
