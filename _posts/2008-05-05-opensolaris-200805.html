<p>For the uninitiated, I'll quote the OpenSolaris docs...</p>

<blockquote>The OpenSolaris 2008.05 release is an OpenSolaris binary distribution. This release provides a Live CD for x86 platforms. This Live CD includes a basic core operating system and GNOME desktop environment, with the option to install the OpenSolaris operating system from the Live CD. Or, you can mount the OpenSolaris OS on a VirtualBox. After the OpenSolaris OS has been mounted or installed, additional packages, including developer tools, can be downloaded to the system by using the Image Packaging System (IPS). A new beadm utility enables you to manage multiple boot environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like your average GNU/Linux LiveCD distro, but it's not.  It's OpenSolaris, and what's more, if you want <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/index.html#support">support</a>, you can get it for as little as $49 per incident.</p>
<p>So head on over and get <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/get/index.html">downloading</a>.  Whilst it's downloading, take the time to browse around the new site.  There's a wealth of information in the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/index.html">Learn</a> (aka knowledge) section, but if you've got a question that isn't answered by the documentation, or have a cool use for your OpenSolaris 2008.05 installation, head on over to the <a href="http://forums.opensolaris.com/">Share</a> (aka forums) section and let the peeps know.</p>
