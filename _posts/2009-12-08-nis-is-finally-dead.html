<p>If you've ever had to setup and troubleshoot NIS+, you'll know what a nightmare it can be and quite frankly how unreliable it is unless you're 100% accurate with all your configuration and settings and really know what you're doing.  Well, you'll also be pleased to know NIS+ is also finally DEAD!!!  </p>
<p>Sun have been been advising that NIS+ will be removed from a future release of Solaris for quite some time in the various docs on docs.sun.com (like the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-4558/c00over-1?l=en&a=view">Naming and Directory Services guide</a> which deals with setting up NIS+) and they've finally pulled the plug.</p>
<p>NIS+ is no longer in <a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> as of build 130 (snv_130), so if you're running NIS+ AND are keeping up to date with OpenSolaris or are planning on migrating to OpenSolaris and are still using NIS+, now's a good time to consider <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-4556/nisplus2ldap-1?l=en&a=view">migrating to LDAP</a> or to the less complex NIS.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot to mention the PSARC (PSARC/2009/530) and <abbr title="Change Request">CR</abbr> ID (6874309) so you can track it down/monitor yourself.</p>
