<p><a href="https://twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/">Michael C Harris</a> sent this out to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/habari-users">habari-users group</a> earlier today, and I thought I'd post it here to try and spread the word a bit and build up a bit of momentum.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Let's give a little push towards releasing 0.7, by doing one thing today to move Habari forward.</p>
<p>Here's a list of things that you could do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the list of tickets left in the 0.7 release and see if you can move one forward (comments, patches, commits, tests). See the list of tickets at <a href="https://trac.habariproject.org/habari/report/14">https://trac.habariproject.org/habari/report/14</a>.</li>
<li>Improve the release notes, which can be found at<br />
<a href="https://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Release_0.7">https://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Release_0.7</a>.</li>
<li>Improve (or start) the pages that are linked to in the release notes. Add some screenshots to the pages, where appropriate.</li>
<li>Find your favorite plugin that outputs to a theme and either add a block or ask someone in #habari to do it.</li>
<li>Where appropriate, add an area to a theme in -extras. Here's a spreadsheet of the themes, and which ones have areas, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnsMFzzpMTLDdG41RmJXT3ROekFOOUpzRXBhNVpKV1E&hl=en&ui=2#gid=1">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnsMFzzpMTLDdG41RmJXT3ROekFOOUpzRXBhNVpKV1E&hl=en&ui=2#gid=1</a></li>
<li>Update an -extras theme to use a FormUI comment form. The spreadsheet above shows which ones have that too.</li>
</ul>

</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a few of us who are quite eager to get Habari 0.7 out the door, but there a couple of things that need to be ironed out before it can see the light of day. So jump right in and give us a hand.</p>
