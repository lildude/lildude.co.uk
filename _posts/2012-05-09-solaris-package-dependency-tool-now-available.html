<p>If you've tried to administer and minimize your Solaris installation, I'm sure you've hit the problem that is easily listing a pkg's dependencies.  Well, not any more.  An 8 year old request for enhancement (RFE)...</p>
<p><a href="https://supporthtml.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/BugDisplay.jspx?id=5012345" target="_blank">5012345 request for tool to list package dependencies</a> (My Oracle Support login required)</p>
<p>... has just been implemented in Solaris 10 and is delivered with patch 119254-84 (SPARC) and 119255-85 (x86).</p>
<p>This patch introduces the <code>/usr/sbin/pkgdep</code> command with the following usage instructions:</p>
<pre class="terminal"># /usr/sbin/pkgdep

Usage:
/usr/sbin/pkgdep [-v] [-c | -m metacluster] [-d package-directory] 
   [-p product-image-path] [-R root-path] package-name

The following options are supported:
-c	Print only dependencies not currently installed on the system.
-d	Specify a directory to check for packages and dependencies.
-m	Print only dependencies not included in specified metacluster.
-p	Specify a product image to check for packages and dependencies.
-R	Specify an alternate system root.
-v	Print full package descriptions.
#</pre>
<p>As the usage message indicates, the usage itself is not very complicated.  If you're curious, this is a Perl script, so if something isn't working as you expect, have a look at the source and see why.</p>
