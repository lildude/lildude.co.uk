<p>The latest release of <a href="http://developers.sun.com/sxde/">Solaris Express Developer Edition (9/07)</a> is now available, and it's a marked improvement over the previous release. </p>
<p>This release includes all the latest tools and technologies from Sun that any developer could want for developing C, C++, Java apps and even Web 2.0 applications. And best of all, it's all nicely bundled together for easy use.</p>
<p>Some of the major highlights include: the <a href="/new-solaris-installer-now-generally-available" target="_blank">new installer I mentioned before</a>, an upgrade to Gnome 2.18, D-Light: a GUI DTrace tool that simplifies using DTrace and a whole lot of other application updates.  Check out the full list on the <a href="http://developers.sun.com/sxde/features.jsp" target="_blank">SXDE page</a>.</p>
<p>Now for something that's not been available before - you can now also purchase a <a href="http://developers.sun.com/sxde/support.jsp" target="_blank">Solaris Subscription</a> that covers basic installation and configuration support for those who are considering rolling out SXDE in a production environment, but can't wait for Solaris 10 to catch up.</p>
<p>If you're curious, or are an application developer, regardless of whether it's C, C++, Java or one of the myriad of Web 2.0 technologies, or you're just anxious to see what <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/" target="_blank">Project Indiana</a> may look like, <a href="http://developers.sun.com/sxde/download.jsp" target="_blank">get your hands on a copy of SXDE 9/07 now</a>.</p>
