<p>Well, that didn't take long.  Just the <a href="http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/01/08/embracing-the-inevitable/">other day Linden Labs released the source code</a> for the Second Life client, and now <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/siva/entry/second_life_client_running_on">Siva has ported it to Solaris</a>.  Nice one.  Now all I need is a powerful enough computer and I may actually give Seconds Life a go (tried it once on my PPC Mac Mini, but it crawled).</p>
