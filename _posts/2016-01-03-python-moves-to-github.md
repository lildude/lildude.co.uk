Great news: [another major project - Python - is moving to GitHub!!](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/core-workflow/2016-January/000345.html) Not so great news: the substantiation for picking GitHub over GitLab, particularly the first point :disappointed:

> I don't think this will be a shock to anyone who has followed the
discussion on this list. The decision is essentially based on:
>
   1. No major distinguishing features between GitHub or GitLab
   2. Familiarity amongst core devs -- and external contributors -- with GitHub
   3. Guido prefers GitHub
>
> Neither platform had some mind-blowing feature(s) that really made them
stand out from each other such that it would greatly simplify our lives if
we chose one platform over another. I obviously was really hoping there was
going to be something I missed, but nothing ever came up (and no, being
open source is not enough of a feature; as I said when I started this
process, being open source would help break ties or minor lead of one tool
but not be a deciding factor).
