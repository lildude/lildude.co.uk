<p>I was just browsing through the menus of my Nevada snv_103 and I stumbled upon an entry I'd not seen before - <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/">Terminator</a>.  So I ran it.  At first I was quite disappointed as it just looked like a normal Gnome terminal; then I right clicked and saw the options to split horizontally and vertically.  Wooohooo!!!  A "multi-terminal in one window" terminal, with tab support too:</p>
<p><img src="/img/terminator.png" alt="Terminator on OpenSolaris" title="Terminator on OpenSolaris" width="579" height="366" class="center" /></p>
<p>This has instantly been promoted to my terminal of choice and replaces a script I wrote that opens 4 terminal windows and then uses <a href="http://www.sweb.cz/tripie/utils/wmctrl/">wmctrl</a> to resize tile them on my desktop.</p>
<p>All  I need to do now is find out how I can get Terminator to open 4 equally sized terminals in one window, in one command, and I'll be even happier.</p>
