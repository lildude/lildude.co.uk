<p>I forgot to take into account the ImageKey returned by image_upload() and image_uploadFromURL(), and AlbumKey returned by album_create(). As of rev 1.0.7/1.1.5, these functions now return an array holding the ID and key. Thanks to devbobo for <a href="http://www.dgrin.com/showpost.php?p=748067&postcount=13">pointing this out</a> so quickly.</p>
