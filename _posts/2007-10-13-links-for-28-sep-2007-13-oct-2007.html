<p>Links of interest for 28 Sep 2007 - 13 Oct 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/12/144258">'Hybrid' HDD Technology To Allow Data Access Without Booting</a> - Nice to see the PC market is finally catching up with Apple.  Apple computers have been able to do this for years.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2194276,00.asp">Firefox Is Going Mobile</a> - I can't help but feel this is a little ambitious. Whilst it's a great idea, given the probable H/W requirements and Firefox's current memory munching issue, I'm going to need a whole PC in my pocket to use Firefox on a mobile.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/jimlaurent/entry/solaris_10_runs_on_sparc">BUSTED! 11 Myths about Solaris on X86/X64 platforms</a> - I'm sure a lot of people believe these myths.  It's nice to see someone set things straight.</li>
<li><a href="http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/10/pgp-whole-disk-encryption-barely.html">PGP Whole Disk Encryption - Barely Acknowledged Intentional Backdoor</a> - Oooo. I wonder who demanded this "feature". I'm sure this has come in handy for some poor company after sacking a sysadmin, but now it's public knowledge, watch out for the trojans abusing it.</li>
<li><a href="http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=3&sessionId=0&resId=1&materialId=paper&confId=13797">Data Corruption at CERN</a> - Interesting research paper on data corruption seen at CERN.  I'd love to have seen the results if they whipped out all the H/W controllers and implemented ZFS and let it do all the work.</li>
</ul>
