<p>I learnt something new today. I learnt the logic behind the numeronyms g11n and i18n as used when referring to locales and languages in the world of computing.</p>
<p><code>g11n</code> = globalisation (I speak the Queen's English as taught in colonial Africa so it's with an s)<br />
<code>g</code> = the first letter of globalisation<br />
<code>n</code> = the last letter of globalisation<br />
... and there are <code>11</code> other letters between the two, which conveniently solves the problem of spelling it incorrectly with a z and correctly with an s ;-) .</p>
<p>The same thing applies to i11n...</p>
<p><code>i11n</code> = internationalisation<br />
<code>i</code> = the first letter of internationalisation<br />
<code>n</code> = the last letter of internationalisation<br />
... and there are <code>18</code> letters between the two.</p>
<p>Simple yet so logical.  Surprised it's taken me this long to learn it, especially considering DEC coined the i11n numeronym back in '70s or '80s according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. </p>
<p>I've just accepted these terms without looking them up. Will need to look into any other odd ones I encounter now.</p>
