<p>As <a href="/solaris-zones-parallel-patching/">promised on Friday</a>, I've taken the plunge and tested applying the latest patch cluster to a fresh Solaris 10u5 installation running 10 zones using the new zones parallel patching feature.</p>
<p>To speed things up and to try and prevent any problems I performed the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jumpstarted the OS (SUNWCuser cluster)</li>
<li>Applied patches 125555-04 and 119254-66 (gives us the parallel functionality)</li>
<li>Created a basic sparse-root zone without any networking</li>
<li>Cloned the zone 9 more times</li>
<li>Create an alternate BE using live upgrade so I had two identical boot environments</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I had the machine setup, I booted into single user mode (so all zones will be in the "installed" state) and set off the first cluster installation using the default options (ie no parallel application).</p>
<p>I then rebooted into single user mode on the alternate boot environment, set num_proc to 10 and applied the patch cluster again.</p>
<p>How's this for a significant difference in time:</p>
<p><!--more--><code>num_proc=1</code></p>

<p>This parallel patching is brilliant, pity we had to wait so long for it.</p>
