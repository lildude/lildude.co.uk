<p>Thus far, this site has been very quiet on the comment/trackback spam front, however my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk">main site</a> has been getting hit by tons of comment spam.  I've been using <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> for some time now and it does a splendid job of catching spam, however I still have to regularily clean out the list of caught spam.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I started noticing a pattern to the IP addresses posting all this spam, so I looked into modifying my <code>.htaccess</code> to block these guys before they even get the chance to post the comment.  Manually doing this is a bit laborious, so I did some investigating and found what looks like the ideal extension... <a href="http://boakes.org/akismet-htaccess-extension">Akismet htaccess Extension</a>.</p>
<p>This is the normal Akismet extension modified to summarise the worst offenders and gives you the option of blocking them via <code>.htaccess</code> without having to manually modify the file.  So now the file is updated based on Akismet.  What a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>I've been running with this extension for just over a week now (since 22 July 2006) and it's done a splendid job already.  </p>
