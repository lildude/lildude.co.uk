<p>Just a quick heads up - Sun has issued a Security Alert about a vulnerability in IPv6 in Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris builds 101 - 107:</p>
<p>SunAlert: <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-251006-1">251006</a><br />
Title:	A Security Vulnerability in Solaris IPv6 Implementation (ip6(7p)) May Cause a System Panic</p>
<blockquote><p>An insufficient validation security vulnerability in the Solaris IPv6 implementation (ip6(7p)) may allow a remote privileged user to panic the system using a crafted packet. This is a type of Denial of Service (DoS).</p></blockquote>
<p>An IDR/ISR is available for this issue and is linked to in the SunAlert.  </p>
<p>If you're in an environment which needs approval before applying any patches, or who can't use test patches in production, the SunAlert also details two workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable IPv6:    <code># ifconfig -a6 down</code></li>
<li>IPFilter Rule:    <code>block in quick all with short</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As this is a publicly available document and vulnerability, it is highly recommended that you apply the IDR/ISR or one of the workarounds ASAP.</p>
<p>If you're not using IPv6 at all, then you have nothing to worry about.</p>
