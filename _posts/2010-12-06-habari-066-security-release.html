<p>I'm a little slow on this one - it was a busy weekend - but we've just pushed out a new security update for Habari following being contacted by <a href="https://www.htbridge.ch/" target="_blank">High-Tech Bridge</a> regarding a low-risk path disclosure vulnerability (<a href="https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/path_disclosure_in_habari.html" target="_blank">HTB22732</a>) and two potential medium-risk XSS flaws (<a href="https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_vulnerability_in_habari.html" target="_blank">HTB22731</a> and <a href="https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_vulnerability_in_habari_1.html" target="_blank">HTB22733</a>).</p>
<p>Chris has provided more details in the <a href="https://habariproject.org/en/habari-066-security-release" target="_blank">announcement post</a> for those interested.</p>
<p>As normal, you can download a zip file from the <a href="https://habariproject.org/en/download" target="_blank">download page</a> or <a href="https://svn.habariproject.org/habari/tags/0.6.6" target="_blank">check out the tag</a> directly from Subversion.  A new Developer Preview will released shortly to address this in that side of things.  Until then, feel free to checkout the latest trunk.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://habariproject.org/en/habari-07-developer-preview-3" target="_blank">0.7 DP3</a> is now available and includes the fixes for these issues.</p>
