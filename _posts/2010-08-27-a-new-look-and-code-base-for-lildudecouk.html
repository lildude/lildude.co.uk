<p>After a lot of coding, deliberation and testing, I'm happy to reveal the "new and improved" (of course it's improved, else it wouldn't be a very good "new" product would it? ;-) ) <a href="http://lildude.co.uk">lildude.co.uk</a>. For those who only read my site via the feed, you'll have to pop by and have a look around.</p>
<p>So what's changed?  Well, first and foremost, I've migrated from Wordpress to <a href="http://habariproject.org" target="_blank">Habari</a> following pretty much the same procedure I used previously and documented: <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/migrating-from-wordpress-to-habari" target="_blank">Migrating from Wordpress to Habari</a>.  </p>
<p>At the same time I create a completely new speedy theme which I've entitled "BlackForest".  I wrote this theme from the ground up with the following intentions and requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be fast</li>
<li>It has to be aesthetically appealing</li>
<li>It has to be relatively simple to maintain</li>
<li>It has to use HTML5 and CSS3 where ever possible</li>
<li>It must use as few images, background or otherwise, as possible</li>
<li>Images should only be used for compatibility reasons (for IE, who else?) or if rendering a desired effect is not possible using HTML or CSS</li>
<li>If the browser's styling and functionality is good enough, don't over-ride it in the theme</li>
<li>Only load Javascript when and where it's needed</li>
<li>It has to be fluid, right down to 480px so it's appealing on mobile devices like iPhones</li>
<li>Too much time must not be spent on IE compatibility - it's not my fault IE doesn't follow all the standards I plan on using</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I think I've managed to meet most of my goals. The only thing not quite met yet is the Javascript requirement - some of the plugins I use need a bit of tinkering.  For those running standards compliant browsers (ie anything other than IE) you'll find that only a single image is used: the feed icon in the sidebar and that's only because Safari doesn't seem to cope with large rounded corners.</p>
<p>I've got a bit more tinkering to do and once I'm done, I may release the theme to the world.  Until then, if you spot any problems, let me know.</p>
