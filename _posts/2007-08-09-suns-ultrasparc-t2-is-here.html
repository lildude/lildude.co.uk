<p>Sun <a href="https://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2007-0807/feature/index.jsp">has now announced</a> the much anticipated <a href="https://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">UltraSPARC T2</a> (aka Niagara 2) processor to the world, and under the GPL too.</p>
<p>The T2 is quite a beast too... it's <strong>ONE</strong> chip with 8 cores that provides the capability of running 64 threads simultaneously.  Add to that multi-threaded 10 Gb ethernet networking, crypto acceleration, PCI-Express I/O expansion and a dedicated <acronym title="Floating point unit">FPU</acronym> per core, and you've got one incredible CPU. There is absolutely NOTHING else on the market that comes anywhere close. Come to think of it, there is only one other 8 core CPU on the market - the <a href="https://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T1/">UltraSPARC T1</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, Sun is setting the pace in the market. The T1 has been out for quite some time now, and still there is no news of a competing 8 core CPU from the likes of IBM, Intel or AMD.</p>
<p>Come on boys, Sun is kicking ass here.</p>
