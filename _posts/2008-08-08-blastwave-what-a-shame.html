<p>If you've popped over to Blastwave.org in the last few days you're likely to have encountered this...</p>

<p>I don't know the exact reason for this, but if the comments on the various forums, eg <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.solaris/browse_thread/thread/caea4ad853bee35/8010b48a2cb46489">comp.unix.solaris</a>, are anything to go by, it's such a shame greed has got the better of a great resource.  </p>
<p>I've never been a big fan of Blastwave (too many non-Solaris supplied dependencies for my liking), but I know many other people are fans and use it quite extensively, but hopefully Dennis or Phil Brown will release an official statement explaining what's potting.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=960">Unofficial update from Ben Rockwood</a> (an outsider like the rest of us). Looks like things have got very smelly between Dennis and Phil :-( </p>
