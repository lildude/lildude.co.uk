<p>Links of interest for 3 Sep 2008 - 11 Sep 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nettuts.com/articles/10-principles-of-the-php-masters/">10 Principles of the PHP Masters</a> - Some very useful PHP tips here.  Some new, some old.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/04/google_retracts_lousy_chrome_eula_terms/">Google restores Chrome's shine</a> - That's better. Now you can still keep ownership of everything you already own.</li>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/livehadoop/">Hadoop Live CD at OpenSolaris.org</a> - Distributed computing on a LiveCD.  What a great way to test the waters without actually having to install anything.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/bmc/entry/happy_5th_birthday_dtrace">Happy 5th Birthday, DTrace</a> - Wow!!! DTrace is 5 years old already.  Wow time flies.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/03/google_chrome_eula_sucks/">Burned by Chrome</a> - All your bases are belong to us.  Not the nicest of EULAs and one that will certainly stop me from using it in the immediate future, assuming it were available for Mac, Linux or even Solaris.</li>
</ul>
