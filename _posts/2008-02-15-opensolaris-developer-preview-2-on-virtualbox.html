<p>I'd never heard of <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> until I heard Sun <a href="https://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2008-0212/feature/index.jsp?intcmp=hp2008feb12_innotek_read">announce</a> they'd be buying innotek - the makes of VirtualBox.  With the news that it could run on OpenSolaris, I thought I'd give it a whirl and see if I could kill two birds with one stone - test both VirtualBox OpenSolaris Beta AND the latest release of <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/">OpenSolaris Developer Preview</a> (OSDP), both on build 80 of Nevada.</p>
<p>Well, it all went a lot better than expected.</p>
<p><!--more-->Downloading and installing VirtualBox was easy.  It's small and lightweight.  What a pleasure when compared to the likes of VMWare. Configuring it a new virtual machine and pointing it to the OSDPv2 iso image was a breeze, and booting the virtual host happened quickly and easily without any problems.  In next to no time I was booting from the OSDPv2 Live CD image:</p>

<p>... and after a short while I was running the full Live CD environment within VirtualBox, and the performance was pretty impressive considering I'd only allocated 512Mb of memory to the virtual host:</p>

<p>I then took the plunge and double clicked the "Install OpenSolaris" icons. Within a few seconds I was presented with the new installer, clicked my way through the 5 simple steps and off it went. About 20 mins later, all was done and I was prompted to reboot, so I did.</p>

<p>Once rebooted, I was presented with this lovely blue login screen...</p>

<p>Now this is where the niggles started.  The default screen res was only 1024xwhatever with 16 bit colour. Thankfully Alan Burlison had already <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/alanbur/entry/kicking_both_tyres_together_virtualbox">done a fair bit of work on this</a>, so I nabbed his <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/alanbur/resource/xorg.conf">xorg.conf</a>.</p>
<p>Next, the network devices used by the Virtualbox need the pcnet device driver (pcn on Solaris).  Unfortunately, this is a closed source driver, so it's not supplied with OSDP.  Now Alan details using the drivers from an SXDE iso image, however I liked the idea of the open source drivers that Wayne Liauh <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/alanbur/entry/kicking_both_tyres_together_virtualbox#comment-1203043089000">mentioned in the comments</a>.  So I headed on over to <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/moinakg/entry/scorched_3d_and_masayuki_san">here</a> via <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=51846&tstart=0">here</a> and grabbed Masayuki San's driver pkgs.</p>
<p>With these in hand, I whipped up a quick ISO image containing the two files and mounted it within the virtual host (the shared storage doesn't seem to work on Solaris just yet).</p>
<p>Once the ISO was mounted within the virtual host, it was a simple matter of putting the xorg.conf into place, installing the SFEnicdrv and SFEnicdrv-ae pkgs and rebooting. The OS picked up the new screen resolution and NWAM plumbed a network interface. Brilliant!!!</p>
<p>All in all, I'm pretty impressed.  The virtual host runs like a dream, especially considering it's only got 512Mb of memory allocated to it, and VirtualBox is really lightweight and quick too.</p>
