<p>Links of interest for 12 Dec 2008 - 24 Dec 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/23/opensolaris_on_atom/">Sun boosts OpenSolaris on Atom</a> - Oooo. When this becomes a reality without any hoop jumping, I may just have to get myself a small Atom based netbook.</li>
<li><a href="https://dotneverland.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-recession-time-and-sun-has-best.html">It's recession time and Sun has the best recession kool aid.</a> - Who needs Oracle and BEA when you can have MySQL and Glassfish, and you can even use Ruby on Rails.  I agree with the final comment in the article - Sun just isn't selling the whole idea very well. I hope someone sees this post and takes it's content to heart.</li>
<li><a href="https://reddevil62-techhead.blogspot.com/2008/12/opensolaris-200811-its-time-is-coming.html">OpenSolaris 2008.11: Its Time Is Coming</a> - Good review.  I like the football analogy at the beginning which finished off quite appropriately with "Before parting, you ask him if he'll play every week and he says he can't because he's moving to Australia on Monday. And you are left wishing you had discovered him much sooner."</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/19/sun_micron_extended_flash_life/">Sun and Micron extend flash life</a> - This is really crucial in what I think is going to be the "big thing" on the storage front in 2009.  One thing to remember, the figures mentioned are at a cell level, not for the entire SSD - people always forget this in the spinning disk vs flash/SSD debate.</li>
<li><a href="https://storagemojo.com/2008/12/08/many-cores-hit-the-memory-wall/">StorageMojo Â» Many-cores hit the memory wall</a> - Good read here about the problems encountered with the ever expanding number of cores on a CPU.  This is exactly the reason the UltraSPARC T1/2 processors have been designed the way they have.  The CPU is multithreaded so whilest we wait for memory for one thread, the others can carry on.  See https://www.sun.com/products/microelectronics/pdfs/Sun-Microelectronics-WindRiver_DS.pdf for more details.</li>
