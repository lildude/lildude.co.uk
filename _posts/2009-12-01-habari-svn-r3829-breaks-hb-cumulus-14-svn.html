<p>Just a quick update to say that Habari introduced <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habari-dev/browse_thread/thread/c62e38ed828093dc?pli=1">some good changes to tags</a> in r3829 of the SVN code.  Unfortunately, these changes break the <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus plugin</a>, just the SVN release.  I hope to release a new rev of this plugin later this week that takes these changes into account.</p>
