<p>Wow!!! I'm totally blown away.  After <a href="/starting-ruby-on-rails/">installing Ruby, Rails, Mongrel & MySQL yesterday</a>, I've just followed <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/12/14/revisiting-ruby-on-rails-revisited.html">this simple tutorial</a> and created by first Ruby on Rails application.  I had no idea how fantastic Ruby on Rails really was.  I'm lost for words - the power is apparent already and I haven't even got into learning about the cool AJAX stuff either. I must have been sleeping under a rock for quite some time as I've certainly been missing out on something awesome.</p>
<p>I'll be putting my PHP development on the back burner for a while - I've got me a new toy to learn. :-)</p>
