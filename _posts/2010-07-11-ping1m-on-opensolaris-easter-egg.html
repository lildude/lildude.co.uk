<p>It's amazing what you discover whilst working a weekend shift with a bit of time to spare.  Whilst perusing through the shell scripts used as part of the Sun in-house built VPN solution (Oracle are giving it the chop in favour of Cisco SSL AnyConnect client which doesn't officially work on Solaris x86 - it does with the help of <a href="http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/">openconnect</a> though ;-) ), I discovered a little easter egg in ping(1M).</p>
<p>Fire up a terminal and ping a host:</p>
<div class="terminal">
<pre>$ ping google.com             
google.com is alive
$
</pre>
</div>
<p>Nothing fancy there and exactly as I expected. However, if you're a Linux/Mac user, this is NOT what you were expecting.  So lets make the Linux/Mac users happy with our new little <a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/ping/ping.c#498">easter egg</a>...</p>
<div class="terminal">
<pre>$ export MACHINE_THAT_GOES_PING=1
$ ping google.com

<p>Now that looks familiar to Linux/Mac users and Solaris users will recognise this as the output you get when using the <code>-s</code> flag.</p>
<p>So, whilst not really anything amazing, this little undocumented environment variable allows you to get the output Linux/Mac users are used to without the need for setting up an alias of continually remembering to add the <code>-s</code> flag.</p>
<p>I've only tested this on OpenSolaris so your experience may vary.</p>
