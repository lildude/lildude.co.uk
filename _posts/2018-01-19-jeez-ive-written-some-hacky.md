Jeez, I've written some hacky code in the past. Just had my attention to something I wrote three years ago which is clearly a hack that doesn't work as I intended. It appears I realised this at the time but only half-backed out the changes 😊. Interestingly, that hacky code was peer-reviewed and accepted 😁.
