<p>Along with an explanation of the SRU and update relationship, there's also this little snippet...</p>
<blockquote cite="https://blogs.oracle.com/Solaris11Life/entry/solaris_11_process_enhancement_no"><p>Changes to SRU and Update Naming Conventions </p>
<p>We're changing the naming convention of Update releases from a date based format such as Oracle Solaris 10 8/11 to a simpler &quot;dot&quot; version numbering, e.g. Oracle Solaris 11.1. Oracle Solaris 11 11/11 (i.e. the initial Oracle Solaris 11 release) may be referred to as 11.0. </p>
<p>SRUs will simply be named as &quot;dot.dot&quot; releases, e.g. Oracle Solaris 11.1.1, for SRU1 after Oracle Solaris 11.1.<br />

<p>Woohooo!!! Almost everyone I've spoken to hated the old "marketing" method of naming Solaris releases.  Solaris 11.0.12 is far easier to understand and explain than "Solaris 11 11/11 with SRU 12".</p>
