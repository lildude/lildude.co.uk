<p>Last week I took the time to download and compile <a href="https://www.enlightenment.org/Enlightenment/DR17/">E17</a> in my home directory on a Solaris 10 Sunray server.  I did this as I use the Sunray for all of my work, and I don't have root access.  Well, I can say, it builds and runs quite happily using everything that is supplied with Solaris 10.  Here's a screenshot (click for full size):</p>
