<p>You know open source software has got to be good when rev 22.1 becomes available.  In this case it's for one of the longest running UNIX editors - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.  Rev 22.1 was released on Saturday. If you're curious, the first release was written and released by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> in 1975.  Despite it's age, I'm still a Vi/Vim person.</p>
