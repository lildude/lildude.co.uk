<p>It's final. OpenSolaris will NOT be dual licensed under the GPLv3, for now. The OGB have <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=23699&tstart=0">announced</a> all efforts have been shelved and will not be considered again until at least 6 months <strong>AFTER</strong> the GPLv3 has been published and approved.</p>
<p>The announcement finishes off nicely with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Further discussion on GPL* is merely a diversion and distraction that should be discouraged, so as to allow the community to concentrate on the higher priority action items - especially those that will improve developer mindshare.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is obviously only referring to discussions on the OpenSolaris forums, but I guarantee, despite the OGB's announcement, this will still be a hot topic of debate and will crop up numerous more times on Slashdot and the likes.</p>
