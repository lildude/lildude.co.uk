<p>I've anxiously been waiting for <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=88368&tstart=0">this update email</a> to say the snv_105 changes are now available for OpenSolaris.</p>
<p>Now I can get playing with the cool new <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/">Project Crossbow</a> networking functionality as Ben did <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=999">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1001">here</a>.</p>
<p>I could have played with this when it first came out, except I took the decision to move 100% across to OpenSolaris on my machine at work instead of running the SXDE builds. No more dual boot. Just 100% OpenSolaris.</p>
