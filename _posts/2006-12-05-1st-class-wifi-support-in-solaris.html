<p>A new WiFi architecture has been <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/on/flag-days/pages/2006112001/">integrated into Nevada Build 54</a> which will pave the way for some pretty cool features in the future, and also will start to bring Solaris inline with (and dare I say, overtake) the likes of Linux on the WiFi front.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Of the changes, the most significant are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The drivers are now part of the GLDv3 (aka nemo) network framework.  Or should I say, the GLDv3 framework now supports WiFi.</li>
<li>The kernel now has a dedicated net80211  kernel module which facilitates code sharing across WiFi drivers, thus easing the development of drivers for different chips.</li>
<li>The preferred way to manage WiFi is with the GLDv3 administration command, <code><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/caselog/2006/623/materials/manpages/dladm-1m/">dladm</a></code> instead of <code>wificonfig</code>.  Whilst <code>wificonfig</code> won't be removed immediately, it's use will be discouraged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that these enhancements have been made, we'll start to see the cool stuff really come to life like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/nwam">Network Auto-Magic (NWAM)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/clearview">Project Clearview</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/Docs/si-design.pdf">IP Instances</a></li>
<li>WPA/WPA2</li>
</ul>
<p>... and of course, a final goodbye to ndd(1M) is even more likely to happen - they've been saying this for ages, now it looks like it's going to finally happen.</p>
<p>Whilst it's a bit sad Solaris has had to play catchup (it's kind of expected from an OS that has spent most of it's life in the data centre/corporate world), at least Sun has had time to sit back, watch the rest, and now implement things properly.</p>
