<p>Links of interest for 13 Jan 2008 - 27 Jan 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nexenta.org/os/TransactionalZFSUpgrades">Transactional ZFS Upgrades on Nexenta</a> - This is pretty impressive usage of ZFS. Once Solaris officially supports ZFS boot, this is a fantastic feature that could be added to patching and live upgrade.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.channelregister.co.uk/2008/01/16/mysterious_web_infection_continues/">Mystery web infection grows, but cause remains elusive</a> - Pity no one seems to have been able to pin-point an underlying OS for the affected web servers.  If something like Solaris, FreeBSD or OS X are involved, DTrace could be used to work out what's going on.</li>
<li><a href="https://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/macosx/Leopard_PT_DENY_ATTACH.20080122.html">Fixing ptrace(pt_deny_attach, ...) on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</a> - Adam Leventhal discovered Apple's crippling of DTrace and this appears to be a possible way of circumventing Apples attempts at stopping DTrace from tracing apps like iTunes.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/ahl/entry/mac_os_x_and_the">Mac OS X and the missing probes - DTrace crippled on OS X</a> - In a way, this isn't really surprising, but it is very disappointing.  What's more, the circumvention appears to be quite trivial. I think the most annoying part is that Apple's crippling of DTrace means a lot of d scripts that rely on tick counts are now</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/hacking-the-interwebs">Hacking The Interwebs - Router UPnP vulnerability</a> - I think we're going to be seeing the affects of this for a long time to come.  The average home user hardly remembers to change the default password, let alone regularily update the firmware.</li>
<li><a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/01/10/simcity-source-code-released-to-the-wild-let-the-ports-begin.aspx">SimCity Source Code Released to the Wild!</a> - I never thought I'd see the day.  Whilst it's not the current release of SimCity, it is a sign of the times.  Who knows, maybe SimCity 4 will be open sourced one day.</li>
</ul>
