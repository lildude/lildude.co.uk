<p>I was a little early this morning with <a href="/updating-to-opensolaris-200906">my post about upgrading</a> as technically OpenSolaris 2009.06 hadn't been released.  Well it has now.  Check out the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=104266&tstart=0">official release announcement</a> for a different "<a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/features/whats-new/200906/">What's New</a> and links to the various downloads. </p>
<p>Oh yes, and SPARC support is now officially included too.</p>
