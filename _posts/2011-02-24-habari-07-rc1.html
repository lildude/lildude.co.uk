<p>Fresh off the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/habari-users" target="_blank">habari-users</a> alias: </p>
<blockquote><p>The first, and hopefully last, Habari 0.7 release candidate has been tagged and is available for download at <a href="http://habariproject.org/dist/habari-0.7-rc1.zip" target="_blank">http://habariproject.org/dist/habari-0.7-rc1.zip</a>. See <a href="http://habariproject.org" target="_blank">habariproject.org</a> for details about the release.</p>
<p>This version is recommended for any plugin authors or themers, as it contains many changes from Habari 0.6. Please install it, and let us know about any lingering issues. We hope to see a very short time before Habari 0.7 stable is released.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get downloading and testing so we can iron out any bugs before pushing 0.7 out the door.</p>
