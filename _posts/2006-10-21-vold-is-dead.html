<p>Woohooo!!! vold is now officially dead - well it will be in the future.  I've just <a href="https://solaristhings.blogspot.com/2006/10/vold-is-dead-long-live-tamarack.html">discovered</a> that vold has been replaced by something called "Tamarack" and with it comes <a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal">hal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joliet_(file_system)">Joliet extensions</a>. This is going to make my support and normal life soooo much easier. Once my laptop has finished rebuilding, I'll have to do a quick bfu and take it for a spin.</p>
