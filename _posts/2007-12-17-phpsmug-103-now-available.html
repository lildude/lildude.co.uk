<p>I've updated the example.php file in the phpSmug 1.0.x to branch to take into account the "Heavy" argument.  Whilst this isn't strictly needed in the example.php, it does cause confusion as it's the first parameter, and the example was only providing the nickname parameter.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rob Nugen for the heads up on this. Ticket <a href="http://dev.lildude.co.uk/phpSmug/ticket/9">#9</a> is now resolved.</p>
