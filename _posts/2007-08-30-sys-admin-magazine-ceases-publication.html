<p>I first heard about this on <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/24/1945228">Slashdot</a> and really didn't believe it.   I can now however confirm that this is indeed true. I received my postcard in the post yesterday. This <del datetime="2007-08-30T10:04:13+00:00">is</del> was probably one of the best tech magazines I've ever subscribed to. I'm going to miss getting my monthly hardcore tech fix.</p>
