<p>Create your own Dropbox clone using Solaris 11.1...</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/sol-howto-webstorage-s111-1940332.html"><p>This article describes a PHP-based open source solution that uses AjaXplorer, Oracle Solaris 11.1, and Apache Web server (although other Web servers can be used) to build a cloud-based storage service that is similar to Dropbox.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also build the storage in the same way using AjaXplorer with other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, when using Oracle Solaris 11.1, you will be able to configure the storage in a more powerful and secure way by taking advantage of ZFS.<br />
