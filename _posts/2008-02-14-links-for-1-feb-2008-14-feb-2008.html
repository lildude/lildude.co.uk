<p>Links of interest for 1 Feb 2008 - 14 Feb 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS8844914464.html?kc=EWKNLLIN021208FEA1">Major Linux security hole found</a> - Ooops.  This is going to be around for some time and I wouldn't be surpised if a worm is created to capitalise on this vulnerability in the not too distant future.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/feb/01/internationalpersonalfinancebusiness.internet">How one clumsy ship cut off the web for 75 million people</a> - Just goes to show how fragile the internet really is. Given that it only took a ship to take out most of the emerging markets, imagine the chaos terrorists could cause if they took out the cables for the western world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/First-Look/Mac/MacBook-Air">iFixit ? MacBook Air</a> - Man pulls Mac Book Air to pieces.  Some people have far too much time and money.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/01/microsoft_bids_for_yahoo/">Microsoft bids $44.6bn! for Yahoo!</a> - Hmmm, I think the regulators may have something to say about this. If it goes ahead, we're pretty much going to end up with a 2 horse search engine race (all others are so far behind it's not worth mentioning).</li>
</ul>
