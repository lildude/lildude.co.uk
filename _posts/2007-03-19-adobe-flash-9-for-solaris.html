<p><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/flash_logo.gif" alt="Flash Logo" />Adobe have finally remembered that there is another OS other than Windows, Linux and OS X that people may use to, oh I don't know, do anything those other OSes do, like browsing the internet - they've finally released Flash 9 for Solaris (<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/">go get it</a>). Woohooo!!! Now all we need is for them to remember that we like to read PDF's on Solaris x86 and could do with a nice upgrade so we don't have to continue using Acrobat Reader 4 or the tools supplied as part of Gnome.</p>
