<p>Links of interest for 3 Jun 2009 - 14 Jul 2009:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1047">"Is Oracle getting ready to kill OpenSolaris?" FUD</a> - Thankfully someone's being sensible about the FUD that made it's way into the news this week.  Oracle is not going to kill OpenSolaris.</li>
<li><a href="http://sun.systemnews.com/articles/136/3/Virtualization/21972">Oracle's Virtualization Gold Mine</a> - Looks like Oracle is counting on Virtualization big time.  Time will tell what they do with all their net technology.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/CMPTRS/idUSN1044924620090610?sp=true">Microsoft will soon unveil free anti-virus software</a> - Kind of ironic, yet potentially a brilliant business plan: you produce some software that becomes an easy target for viruses, then release your own anti-virus.  It'll be free today, but who knows what will happen in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/osarm/">ARM Platform Port at OpenSolaris.org</a> - Cool. OpenSolaris for ARM procs.  If ARM netbooks pick up as Google is anticipating, we could find OpenSolaris as one of the runners in the choices of OS.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.dailymotion.com/2009/05/27/watch-videowithout-flash/">Watch Video&hellip;without Flash</a> - I've been waiting for this for a long long time.  Finally video, and other fancy stuff, coming to a browser near you WITHOUT the need for 3rd party plugins.  At the moment, only Firefox 3.5 beta has support, but other browsers will follow suit.</li>
</ul>
