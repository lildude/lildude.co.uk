<p>If, like me, you're not made of money and are still running a PowerPC Mac, you would have no doubt been a bit disappointed to hear only an Intel version of OpenOffice 3.0 was released to the world.</p>
<p>Well there's no need to be disappointed anymore, you can <a href="https://ooopackages.good-day.net/pub/OpenOffice.org/MacOSX/">get builds from the community team</a> responsible for the Mac port. The latest version available if RC4, but it seems to work a treat on my dated Mac Mini:</p>
