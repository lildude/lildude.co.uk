<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/toshibanotebook/">Toshiba OpenSolaris Laptops</a> - You can now get your hands on the much touted Opensolaris Toshiba laptops.  Sadly, it#039;s US only at the mo with UK availability expected sometime in May 2009.  I guess I#039;ll have to wait a bit, but it#039;ll be good to start hearing the reviews to see how these things run.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/JeffV/entry/patching_zones_goes_zoom">Accelerated Patching of Zoned Systems</a> - Woohooo!!!! Patching of systems with zones is about to get a lot quicker.  Jeff provides some good data here just to whet your appetite in anticipation of the quot;Zones Parallel Patchingquot; (ZPP) patch.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jmr/entry/packagemanager_for_2009_06">PackageManager for 2009.06</a> - Some good improvements coming to the pkg manager in the next release of OpenSolaris.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/janp/entry/the_code_chrootdirectory_code_option">The ChrootDirectory option resynced to SunSSH</a> - After a lot of demanding, SunSSH has finally got the OpenSSH chrootdirectory functionality as of snv_112.  Not sure if this will be backported though.  Time will tell.</li>
<li><a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/">Adobe Acrobat Reader 9.1 Now Available for Solaris 10 x86</a> - It took long enough.  Now Adobe just need to get some parity between the SPARC and x86 releases.</li>
