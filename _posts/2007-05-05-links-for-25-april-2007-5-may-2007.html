<li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/04/sun_proximity_communications/">Sun's chip gurus theorize about obliterating IBM and Intel</a> - Now I'd love to see this happen. This looks like some pretty impressive technology if Sun can pull it off.</li>

<li><a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.pdf">Google Whitepaper on Disk Failures</a> - Sounds like a good reason to implement ZFS to me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.olix0r.net/bitbucket/index.cgi/netbsd/zfs">ZFS for NetBSD</a> - Soon only Linux won't have ZFS built in, and instead they'll have to rely on the slow Fuse-ZFS.  Aggg, shame.</li>
