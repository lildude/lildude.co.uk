<li><a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2008/03/08/jvm_for_the_iphone/">Snap Sun decision launches Java at iPhone</a> - Cool. No hopefully people will start creating some useful Java apps for the iPhone (and other phones) and not just games.</li>

<li><a href="http://james-morris.livejournal.com/26945.html">OpenSolaris to adopt Flask/TE security scheme</a> - Looks like OpenSolaris will be getting Mandatory Access Control that should be inter-operable with SELinux.</li>
