<p>I've had a busy couple of afternoons quashing bugs and enhancing <a href="https://phpsmug.com">phpSmug</a> further. This release sees the re-introduction of anonymous method call caching (Ticket #18), enableCache() now checks cache directory is writeable (Ticket #19), die_on_error is now acknowledged consistently. If die_on_error is NOT set, it's up to the application developer to check getErrorCode and getErrorMessage after each method call. (Ticket #20), I've added clearCache() function to easily empty the cache. (Ticket #22) and I've Stopped caching the results of failed method calls when die_on_error is set. (Ticket #23).</p>
