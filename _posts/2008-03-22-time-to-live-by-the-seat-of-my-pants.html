<p>I'm about to live on the wild side: I'm about to upgrade Wordpress on this site to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">2.5 RC1 sneak peak</a> that was announced the other day. If you see any errors or any problems, please ignore them for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, that was quite painless.  I can't say I'm too impressed with the new admin interface. It's certainly very pretty, but why such big fonts and sooooo much white space? This is the "<em>behind the scenes</em>" interface - I want it to be simple and concise.  Thankfully there's already an awesome admin theme - <a href="http://www.deanjrobinson.com/projects/fluency-admin/">Fluency Admin Plugin</a> - (<a href="http://www.adii.co.za/2008/03/14/sexy-wordpress-blogging-has-never-been-this-hot/">thanks for the pointer Adii</a>) that makes things look much better.</p>
<p>I'll have to play a bit more before I can make any more comments on the new features and functionality.</p>
