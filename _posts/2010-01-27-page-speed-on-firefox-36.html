<p>Looks like Google have been caught napping slightly.  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox 3.6</a> has been in development for while and has been out for nearly a week now and we still don't have an officially compatible version of the <a href="https://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/">Google Page Speed</a> extension.</p>
<p>Well, all is not lost, it appears Page Speed continues to work correctly and as expected in Firefox 3.6.  All you need to do is bump the "<code>em:maxVersion</code>" number in the <code>install.rdf</code> file included in the extension. I've set this to <code>3.6.*</code> and the extension works a treat.</p>
<p>If you already have the plugin installed, you'll just need to modify this file in the extension directory in the <a href="https://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox">profile directory</a> on your system.   If you don't have the extension installed already, you'll need to unpack the extension (it's a zip file), make the change, repackage the extension (zip up the files with a .xpi extension) and try installing again.</p>
