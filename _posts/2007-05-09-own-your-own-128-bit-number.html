<p>As I <a href="/most-newsworthy-16-digit-number">mentioned earlier</a> when this whole AACS key issue kicked off, the DMCA effectively allows any individual to "<em>own</em>" a number or word.  It didn't take long, but <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1155">now you too can abuse the DMCA by staking your claim on your own 128-bit number</a>. It's a bit pointless, but it does highlight the stupidity of the DMCA.</p>
