<p>If you're not in the US, you're not likely to see this advert Oracle are placing on the front page of the Wall Street Journal...<br />

<!-- Sun Customers. Oracle Plans to:<br />
1. Spend more money developing SPARC than Sun does now;<br />
2. Spend more money developing Solaris than Sun does now;<br />
3. Have more than twice as many hardware specialists selling and servicing SPARC/Solaris systems than Sun does now;<br />
4. Dramatically improve Sun's hardware performance by tightly integrating Oracle software with Sun hardware.</p>
<p>"We're in it to win it. IBM, we're looking forward to competing with you in the hardware business." - Larry Ellison. --></p>
<p>Looks very promising and given the fact Oracle are already doing a better job of marketing Sun, which it doesn't even own yet, I think we could be seeing a lot more marketing too.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This advert is also on the Oracle site over <a href="https://www.oracle.com/features/suncustomers.html">here</a>.</p>
