<p>The recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> purchase by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is one of those familiar stories from the dot com boom of the late '90s.</p>
<p>As true with most of the old dot com stories, YouTube was started by three guys in their garage and evolved into a huge success and take over opportunity, which Google duly took up for a whopping $1.65 Billion.  Not bad for a website/company that doesn't actually make a profit.</p>
