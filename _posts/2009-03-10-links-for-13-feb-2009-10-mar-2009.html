<p>Links of interest for 13 Feb 2009 - 10 Mar 2009:</p>

<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/dp/entry/speeding_to_a_halt">Speeding to a Halt</a> - Wow!!! OpenSolaris shutdown taken from about 41 seconds to a mere 7.  Brilliant work here by Dan Price.</li>
<li><a href="https://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2009/03/06/anatomy-of-storage-on-the-grid/">Anatomy of Storage on the GRID</a> - First Joyent, now MediaTemple. It's great to see large, popular ISPs moving across to OpenSolaris and ZFS to power their grid, hosting and storage offerings.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/hp_joins_solaris_community_live">HP Joins Solaris Community (Live Free or Die)</a> - This is brilliant news, for Sun and all those HP customers running Solaris (and I know of some big banks on this list).  Now I can't name a single large-scale corporate computer vendor who hasn't joined the Solaris OEM market. Lets hope this turns into some good returns for Sun.</li>
<li><a href="https://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-announce/2009-February/002043.html">OpenSolaris Build 107 for x86/x64/SPARC now available.</a> - Build 107 now available in the dev repository. Be sure to read this release mail before updating as there are several known issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/terabit-ethernet-becomes-a-photonic-possibility.ars">Terabit Ethernet becomes a photonic possibility</a> - Now imagine having your broadband connection running at these speeds.</li>
