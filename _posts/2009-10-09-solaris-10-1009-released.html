<p>Sun has quietly released Solaris 10 10/09 (aka update 8 ) and it is now available for <a href="https://sun.com/solaris/get">download</a>.  As usual, the "<a href="https://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/821-0382">What's New</a>" doc has all the gory details of what's new in this release, but for the lazy, here's a quick summary of some of the more significant new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now install and boot from a large device up to 2TB</li>
<li>ZFS flash install support</li>
<li>User and group level ZFS quotas</li>
<li>ZFS cache devices - use those new SSD devices here</li>
<li>Several ZFS property enhancements</li>
<li>Improved ZFS ACL support</li>
<li>shadowAccount on LDAP Support in PAM</li>
<li>Turbo charged pkg installation and patching</li>
<li>Many driver enhancements</li>
<li>Freeware version upgrades, notably Samba has been upgraded to 3.0.35</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are also the usual plethora of bug fixes included too and the new kernel patch for this release (14144[45]) should be out soon.</p>
<p>Whilst the release of this revision has been rather quiet so far, I suspect there will be a bit more fan fair about it at Oracle OpenWorld this weekend.</p>
