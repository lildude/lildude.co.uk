<p>Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you my first Habari plugin: HB-Cumulus.</p>
<p>HB-Cumulus is a Flash-based tag cloud for <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a> that displays your tag cloud in a rotating sphere just like the one shown here.  </p>
<div class="center">[WP-CUMULUS]</p>
<p><small>(The example demonstrated here is actually WP-Cumulus as this site is still on Wordpress, but the appearance and functionality is identical in HB-Cumulus, with slightly different configuration options)</small></div>
<p>HB-Cumulus is a port of the brilliant <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/">WP-Cumulus</a> by <a href="http://www.roytanck.com">Roy Tanck</a> and supports pretty much everything WP-Cumulus does.</p>
<p>Further details, and download links can be found on the <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>If you encounter any problems or have any queries, please leave your comments on this post.</p>
