<p>Well, in a bid to see if Wordpress really needs to preload all those options set to autoload, and to see if it makes a difference on the <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/wordpress-is-a-memory-hog/">memory consumption I detailed earlier</a>. I've set them all to "no" on this site so nothing is autoloaded.  If you encounter any problems, please let me know.  If I don't hear anything, I can only assume they don't have any adverse effect.</p>
