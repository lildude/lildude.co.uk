<p>As time goes on, more and more of the old Sun websites and domains are being shutdown and moved across to Oracle systems and domains.</p>
<p>One of the things that has recently moved is the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/sun-az-index-095901.html" target="_blank">Sun Downloads (the A-Z list)</a>.  The page exists and all the links are valid, however some of them don't take you to the actual product download.  Instead they take you to a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/us/support/044752.html" target="_blank">generic page</a> documenting the migration.</p>
<p>On this page is a link to an FAQ and the general answers is: if you can't get to a download from the A-Z page, you need to use the "Advanced Search" feature under "Patches & Updates" on <a href="https://support.oracle.com" target="_blank">My Oracle Support</a>.</p>
<p>For example, this is how you'd find the latest Ultra 20 M2 Tools ISO image:</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Ultra 20 Tools Download.jpg" src="/img/U20Download.jpg" width="677" height="217" /></p>
<p>You should be able to find things like Sun Grid Engine, LDoms, Java Web Console, SunMC, graphics drivers, etc within My Oracle Support.</p>
