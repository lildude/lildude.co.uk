<p>I was a little slow on the uptake, but <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">Wordpress 2.5</a> was officially released to the world yesterday.  I've now upgraded all my blogs (<a href="http://lildude.co.uk">lildude.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk">colinseymour.co.uk</a>) to WP 2.5. Now to put the finishing touches my SmugGal plugin and I may just had a workable pluggin for everyone within a few weeks.</p>
