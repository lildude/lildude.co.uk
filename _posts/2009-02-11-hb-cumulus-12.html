<p>I've just pushed out a new revision of <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus">HB-Cumulus</a>.  This isn't a major update, rather more of a maintenance update in which I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated tagcloud.swf to that provided with WP-Cumulus 1.18, which includes a change that... <em>"Improves mouse detection in transparent mode"</em></li>
<li>Sorted out the documenting of the licensing of the various components</li>
<li>Updated directory structure to better separate the 3rd party components and the HB-Cumulus code</li>
<li>Tidied up code to adhere closer to the Habari coding standards</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the latest revision from the <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a new release, I've closed comments on the <a href="/hb-cumulus-11/">1.1 post</a>.  If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.2 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
