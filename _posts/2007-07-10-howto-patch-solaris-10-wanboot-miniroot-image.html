<p>Details on patching the Solaris wanboot/netinstall miniroot image for jumpstart are a bit scarce as, generally speaking, there should be no reason to patch the wanboot miniroot. However due to various issues with Solaris 10 releases, patching of the miniroot has become necessary.</p>
<p>This post details how to patch the wanboot/netinstall miniroot image.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
1.  Create just the boot image:</p>
<p><code># /cdrom/cdrom0/s0/Solaris_10/Tools/setup_install_server -b /path/to/boot-dir</code></p>
<p>2.  Patch the boot image:</p>
<p><code># PKG_NONABI_SYMLINKS=true patchadd -C /path/to/boot-dir/Solaris/Tools/Boot &lt;patchid&gt;</code></p>
<p>... where <code>&lt;patchid&gt;</code> is the patch ID, eg <code>118833-36</code>.</p>
<p>3.  Generate the wanboot image:</p>
<p><code># cd /path/to/boot-dir/Solaris_10/Tools<br />
# ./setup_install_server -w /path/to/miniroot-dir/ /path/to/tmp-dir</code></p>
<p>4.  Copy miniroot to desired location</p>
<p><code># cp /path/to/miniroot-dir/miniroot /var/apache/htdocs/wanboot10/miniroot</code></p>
<p>You miniroot should now be patched.</p>
<p>Here's the output you can expect to see (it may differ slightly on your system):</p>

         The WAN boot Image file has been placed in
                 /export/s10-miniroot/miniroot

         Ensure that you move this file to a location
         accessible to the web server, and that the
         WAN boot configuration file wanboot.conf(4)
         for each WAN boot client contains the entries:

                 root_server=&lt;URL&gt;
                         where &lt;URL&gt; is an HTTP or HTTPS URL
                         scheme pointing to the location of the
                         WAN boot CGI program

                 root_file=&lt;miniroot&gt;
                         where &lt;miniroot&gt; is the path and file
                         name, relative to the web server
                         document directory, of 'miniroot'

         You should also make sure you have initialized
         the key generation process by issuing (once):

                 # /usr/sbin/wanbootutil keygen -m

<p>You may get the following error when running the "<code>setup_install_server -w</code>":</p>
<pre>
ERROR: The product distribution does not contain
        a product table of contents

<p>This will be due to the lack of <code>.cdtoc</code> in <code>/export/s10-boot</code>.  You can copy this directly from the cdrom.</p>
