<p>Well, almost.  Sun has finally worked through all the regulatory issues and <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-05/sunflash.20070503.1.xml">now developers, researcher and just about anyone from 24 countries across the world</a> can take advantage of Sun's Grid Compute Utility available from <a href="http://www.network.com">Network.com</a> for $1/CPU hour. What's more, if you sign up now, you will get 200 CPU-hrs free.</p>
<p>Why build your own grid for your research when you can let someone else worry about the systems? Now you can concentrate purely on your research or development.</p>
