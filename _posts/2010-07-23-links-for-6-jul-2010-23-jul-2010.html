<p>Links of interest for 6 Jul 2010 - 23 Jul 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/6765-Oracle-Solaris-Support-on-HP-Proliant-and-BladeServers.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Wwwc0t0d0s0org+%28a+www.c0t0d0s0.org+feed%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Oracle Solaris Support on HP Proliant and BladeServers - c0t0d0s0.org</a> - I think Oracle may have seen the light and realised there's actually good money in offering Solaris support on 3rd party hardware. Time will tell if this is extended to other vendors.</li>
<li><a href="http://gdamore.blogspot.com/2010/07/please-be-patient.html">/dev/dump: Please Be Patient</a> - Be patient folks. Looks like we'll be hearing a bit more from Oracle re OpenSolaris in early August.</li>
<li><a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/">WordPress And Thesis Go To Battle. Mullenweg May Sue.</a> - The outcome of this will be interesting and certainly tests the interpretation of the GPL.  What is great about all this is Habari wouldn't have this issue as it's licensed under version 2 of the Apache License. Whilst this doesn't play nice with GPLv3, it does play nice with proprietary code.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1134">OGB Threatens to Shoot Itself In The Head</a> - I agree with Ben here; the OGB are being a bit childish here and if they go ahead they'll do more damage than good.  It's not as if the OGB has actually done anything beneficial - if they have I certainly can't point it out.</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/translation_iphone_4">Daring Fireball: Translation From Apple's Unique Dialect of PR-Speak to English of the 'Letter From Apple Regarding iPhone 4'</a> - A great &quot;translation&quot; of Apple's letter concerning the iPhone 4's signal problems.</li>
