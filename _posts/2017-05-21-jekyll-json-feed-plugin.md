![JSON feed icon](/img/json-feed.png){:class="alignright"} Friday afternoon, whilst waiting for some really slow tests and builds to finish, I made a thing. I took the [Jekyll Feed Plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed), mangled it and produced the [Jekyll JSON Feed plugin](https://github.com/lildude/jekyll-json-feed) so you too can have all the awesomeness of [JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) on your Jekyll site.

Thanks to the way the Jekyll Feed plugin is written, and the fact writing and formatting JSON is so easy, it really didn't take long at all.

All my sites are using this plugin and offering a JSON feed.
