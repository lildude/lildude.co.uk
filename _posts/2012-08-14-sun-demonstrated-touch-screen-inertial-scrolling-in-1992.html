<p>One of the major patents being discussed in the Apple vs Samsung cases is inertia scrolling which Apple claims it invented.  However, this is a bit of a porky as Sun Microsystems once worked on a PDA type device called the Star7 (for which Java was initially invented for) back in the 90s which had inertia scrolling.</p>
<p>Check out the hideous interface demonstrated by James Gosling (of Java fame) and its inertial scrolling...</p>

<p>Bet you don't want one of those for any reason other than to be able to say you have one.</p>
