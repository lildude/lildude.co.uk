<p>The OpenSolaris development <a href="http://pkg.opensolaris.org/">package repository</a> has been updated to reflect the changes in snv_97 including major fixes to the Caiman "Slim Install" and the Image Packaging System (IPS).</p>
<p>Time to get updating if you're "living on the edge" of the OpenSolaris world. Update instructions are now <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/rn3/image-update/">available online</a> and not just within the announcement emails, but I'm sure you're all familiar with the process by now.</p>
