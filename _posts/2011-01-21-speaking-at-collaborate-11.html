<p><img class="alignright" alt="Collaborate 11" src="/assets/collab11.png" width="375" height="102" /> I've just had the fortunate luck to be selected to provide a presentation at <a href="http://collaborate.oaug.org/" target="_blank">Collaborate 11</a> this year.</p>
<p>The topic: </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sun Support and Patching Strategies - Want to streamline your patching strategy for your SUN systems? </strong></p>
<p>Attend this session, and learn how in a live demo. In addition to a patching strategy overview, this session will walk you through a strategy that includes the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>how to locate and download patches,</li>
<li>how to see and compare patches currently applied in your environment, and</li>
<li>how to leverage My Oracle Support Communities to resolve your patching questions in a real-time, self-serve manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make the most of your software and support investment as you learn about the tools and resources available to you. You'll leave this session equipped to plan an end-to-end patching strategy for your Oracle Sun systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you're going, and you read this, pop by and say hello. I promise I'll try not to make it a death-by-slides session.</p>
