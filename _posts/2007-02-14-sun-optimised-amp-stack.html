<p>If you've just got yourself a <del datetime="2007-02-14T17:55:50+00:00">nice</del> brilliant shiny new bit of Sun kit, like the T2000, via the <a href="http://www.sun.com/tryandbuy">Try and Buy</a> or <a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials/">Startup Essentials</a>, and are looking to put this kit to work as the face of your company (it's webserver), then this is for you.  </p>
<p>Sun have come to the rescue to ensure you get the most from your Sun kit running Solaris 10 and the Apache - MySQL - PHP (AMP) stack with the least amount of effort and with maximum performance.  May I introduce you to the "<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/amp/">Sun Optimized AMP Stack</a>".</p>
<p>Download (SPARC & x86/x64), install (pkgadd) and then thrash your server and try and break it.  Now compare these stats with your own compiled binaries, or those running on Linux.  I'm sure you'll be impressed.</p>
