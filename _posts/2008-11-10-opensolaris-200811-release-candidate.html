<p>If you're eager to get your hands on OpenSolaris 2008.11, then you can get testing with the release candidate.  It's been <a href="https://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/indiana-discuss/2008-November/013371.html">decided/announced</a> that snv_101a will be the release candidate for 2008.11, and as is common the <a href="https://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/indiana-discuss/2008-November/013371.html">announcement</a> includes details on how you can update and get testing now.</p>
<p>Please note, this release has a minimum memory requirement of 768Mb for the installer to work (Dave Miner thinks it's <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/dminer/entry/opensolaris_2008_11_release_candidate">probably actually in the region of about 580Mb</a> for those with VMs) at the moment, though this is being worked on in an attempt to bring it back down below 512Mb before the official release.</p>
<p>So get updating and testing and <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/reporting_bugs/">report any bugs</a> you encounter.</p>
