<p>I've been waiting for this for a while as I don't have VMWare and didn't really want to go that route considering <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a> is just as good, if not better (I have to say that ;-) ).  Anyway, thanks to Virtualbox's new ability to support OVF and host-only networking (as of 2.2.2), a simulator image for Virtualbox is possible.</p>
<p>I've not played with it much, yet, but the simulated setup of the appliance is amazingly simple.  It's no wonder it's the "<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/05/sun_amber_road/">faster ever ramping product in Sun's storage product portfolio</a>".</p>
