<p>I work with a couple of guys who are quite stuck in their ways and are quite reliant on old tools, one of which is xclipboard(1).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gnome comes with it's own clipboard manager, so when you try to run xclipboard, you get the following:</p>
<div class="terminal">$ xclipboard<br />
Error: another clipboard is already running<br />
$</div>
<p>Of course, ps(1M) will show no clipboard related processes running.  This is because the functionality is performed by Gnome itself, I believe, as part of the functionality of gnome-settings-daemon.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues gave me the challenge of getting xclipboard working on Gnome on OpenSolaris/Nevada, ie Gnome 2.6, and I found it quite easy to do in the end.  </p>
<p>The trick is to tell Gnome not to perform this functionality anymore as follows:</p>
<p><!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Open up a terminal and fire up <code>/usr/bin/gconf-editor</code></li>
<li>In the window that opens, go to Edit -> Find and search for "clip"</li>
<li>Select <code>/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/plugins/clipboard</code> from the bottom part of the window <small>[1]</small></li>
<li>Untick the "active" box in the right hand pane <small>[2]</small>
<p><img src="/img/gconfeditorclip.jpg" alt="gconf-editor" width="500px" class="center" /></li>
<li>Close the window</li>
<li>Log out and log in again *</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.  xclipboard should now work with Gnome.</p>
<p><img src="/img/xclipboardgnome.jpg" alt="xclipboard running with Gnome" class="center" /></p>
<p>You can of course make this change via the CLI in one command, and then verify it using gconftool-2(1):</p>
<div class="terminal">$ gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/plugins/clipboard/active 0 \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--type bool<br />
$ gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/plugins/clipboard/active<br />
false<br />
$</div>
<p>* The log out /log in is needed for the change to take effect without any adverse effects.  Unfortunately my results were quite inconsistent if I didn't log out after making the gconf change.  The log out/log in was the only thing that kept things consistent. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>This change works under Linux too. </p>
