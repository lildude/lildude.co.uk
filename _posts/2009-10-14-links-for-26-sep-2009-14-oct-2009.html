<p>Links of interest for 26 Sep 2009 - 14 Oct 2009:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://xkcd.com/649/">xkcd - Static</a> - Hee hee hee</li>
<li><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/22328/Guest_Account_Bug_in_Snow_Leopard_Causes_Data_Loss">Guest Account Bug in Snow Leopard Causes Data Loss</a> - Ooops.  Just as well I disabled this account a long time ago.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-10371347-264.html?tag=newsLeadStoriesArea.1">MySQL ex-CEO tells EU to let Oracle buy Sun</a> - Some very valid points here. Lets hope the EU listens and pulls finger.  Their heel dragging is causing more harm than the acquisition would.</li>

I've not embraced &quot;cloud computing&quot; in this sense as I don't really need it, but more importantly I don't like not knowing I can easily move across to another provider in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html">Moserware: A Stick Figure Guide to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a> - XKCD-esque stick figure comic explaining the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): where it came from, why it was necessary, and most-illuminatingly, how it works. Very good.</li>
