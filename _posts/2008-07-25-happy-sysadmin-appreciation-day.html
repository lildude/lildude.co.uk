<p>I'm not a sysadmin in the true sense of the word - I only tend administer the machines I'm using for testing and my own personal machines - but I am one of those people behind the sysadmins, helping them out when things go wrong and on those rare occasions when sysadmins don't even know what to do, so I suppose I can partake in today's "<a href="http://www.sysadminday.com">celebrations</a>" too.</p>
<p>Maybe we should introduce a "Those that Support SysAdmins Appreciation Day".</p>
