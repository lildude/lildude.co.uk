<p>Links of interest for 19 July 2007 - 2 August 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3555.htm">OS X is Now Officially UNIX</a> - Now you can legitimately call OS X "UNIX with a pretty face". OS X has been certified to UNIX03 standards, like Solaris, AIX and HP-UX.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2164136,00.asp">Bubble 2.0 Coming Soon</a> - Dvorak believes we're in for another pop. Maybe, maybe not.  Only time will tell.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/26/sun_2048_thread_niagara/">Sun preps 2048-thread monster</a> - I really hope Sun can deliver on this.  If they do, they'll be so far ahead of the like of IBM, Intel and AMD it won't be funny.  None of these companies are even mentioning this many threads in the news, let alone having this many by the end of 2008</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/07/yslow_release_o.html">YSlow Release on Yahoo Developer Network</a> - This could prove to be a very useful tool.  I'll have to give it a go to see what it suggests.</li>
<li><a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/13975">Tools: GCC 4.2.1 Released</a> - This is the last GPLv2 release of GCC.  I'm just waiting for all the FUD to start flying about GCC moving to GPLv3.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/07/too_many_linux.html">Too Many Linux Distros Make For Open Source Mess</a> - I couldn't agree more.  Do we really need over 300 different Linux distro's?</li>
</ul>
