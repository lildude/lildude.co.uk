<ul>
<li><a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/mysql_perf_tune.html">MySQL InnoDB Performance Tuning for the Solaris 10 OS</a> - It's not been long since the finalisation of Sun's acquisition of MySQL and performance tuning docs are already starting to come to light.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sunay/entry/network_in_a_box_creating">Network in a Box (Creating real network on your laptop)</a> - Create a real network comprising of Hosts, Switches and Routers as a Virtual Network on a any computer using OpenSolaris (w/ Project Crossbow) and zones. Pretty impressive stuff here, and full instructions too.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jimlaurent/entry/playing_with_zfs_usb_memory">Playing with ZFS, USB memory disks and VMware Fusion</a> - Demo ZFS using 3 USB memory sticks, a USB hub and Solaris.  You don't have to use VMWare if you don't want to, but it helps if you want to demo this on another OS other than Solaris/OpenSolaris</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1257">Cold Boot Attacks on Disk Encryption</a> - An interesting way to take advantage of a limitation of today's DRAM memory to grab things like encryption keys before they're lost from DRAM, even after powering off the machine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Enclosed-but-not-encrypted--/features/110136/0">When 128-bit AES encryption isn't anything more than an XOR.  A great explanation into the flawed and supposed 128-bit AES encryption offered by one disk manufacturer.</a> - %extended%</li>
