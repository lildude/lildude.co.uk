<p>Links of interest for 27 Jan 2010 - 14 Feb 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/knowledge/eweek-s-top-25-technologies-of-the-decade-3350">eWEEK's Top 25 Technologies Of The Decade</a> - Including Solaris 10 - &quot;During the latter half of '00s, Sun Microsystems' Solaris 10 sat at the leading edge of operating system technologies, with unique capabilities that include Containers virtualisation, Dtrace system instrumentation and the ZFS file system. Solaris 10 also helped put a stamp of inevitability on the x86-64 architecture and on the open-source-as-a-platform licensing strategy.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100126w0003.htm#10012667000351">UK Govt Say "No Evidence" IE is Less Secure</a> - Or more precisely, &quot;There is no evidence that moving from the latest fully patched versions of Internet Explorer to other browsers will make users more secure.&quot;  Probably true, but find me ONE government department, other than the techies themselves, running a fully patched version of Windows and IE.  That's where the problem is.  Large companies and governments don't like to change things without testing them first, often for 3 - 6 months before rolling them out.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/371751/">H.264 has 900 Patents!!!</a> - Wow!!! If ever there was something that would scare you off using something free, then this is it.  With 900 patents for a single bit of technology, that's a lot of potential for frivolous litigation.  Now you know why Mozilla are fighting against implementing H.264 in Firefox.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/2010/01/html5-video-and-h-264-what-history-tells-us-and-why-were-standing-with-the-web/">HTML5 video and H.264 &ndash; what history tells us and why we&rsquo;re standing with the web</a> - A very good (and long) article on why we really don't want H.264 to become the common codec for HTML5 video.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/technology/business-computing/27oracle.html">With Sun, Oracle Aims At Giants - NYTimes.com</a> - Sun has wonderful engineering, but they didnt seem to like selling very much, Mr. Ellison said. The partner model was disastrous, and we are immediately changing that.  Wow!!! Now why didn't someone at Sun realise this years ago?</li>
