<p>It's quite amazing how a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=09-f9-11-02-9d-74-e3-5b-d8-41-56-c5-63-56-88-c0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">single 16 digit number</a> can <a href="https://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg_users_revolt_ov.html">cause so much controversy</a> and actually be newsworthy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's the sad state of affairs when a super power allows an overly aggressive and vague law, in this case the DMCA, to be made.  This law effectively allows any organisation to "<em>own</em>" silly things like a 64 bit number or a word used in certain contexts - all they need to do is prove that this number is of limited use and circumvents some form of usage limitation/DRM and Bob's your auntie, this number can't be published (well, at least in the US).</p>
<p>The thing I find amazing is that the <a href="https://www.aacsla.com/">AACS-LA</a> (the entity that licenses AACS to makers of HD-DVD players) didn't learn from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS</a> debacle and insisted on <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005229.php">issuing take down notices</a>.  This works fine for ISPs, but people will just go out of their way to make the key available by other means, like having it <a href="https://www.hd-dvd-tee.com/">printed on a T-Shirt</a>, or even by using the digits in some other form like this lovely "rainbow":</p>
<div class="center">
<span style="background-color:#09f911">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#029d74">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#e35bd8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#4156c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#635688">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#c00000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</div>
<p>I've not explicitly published the key here - I've just printed a row of colourful boxes.</p>
<p>I'm just waiting for the day some large media corporation does something stupid like use the word "movie" or "dvd" to encrypt a DVD and the press find out.  I know it won't happen in such a simple form, but anything is possible these days.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Apparently take down notices have been sent to many sites that the display the key.  Well, it seems the MPAA site will display the key if you enter them in a <a href="https://www.mpaa.org/search_resultIndexServer.asp?query=09F911029D74E35BD84156C5635688C0">query on their search page</a>.</p>
