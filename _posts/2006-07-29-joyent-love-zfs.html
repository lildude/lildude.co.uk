<p><a href="https://www.joyent.com">Joyant</a>, the people behind <a href="https://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> and <a href="https://www.strongspace.com">Strongspace</a> are really keen on <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> and ZFS and actually use it in their <a href="https://joyeur.com/">production environment</a>, and they're not afraid to advertise it either...</p>

<p>I don't use any Joyent products yet (but might when my current hosting plan runs out), but I must get myself one of these T-Shirts  (I prefer the <a href="https://store.joyent.com/products/show/5">plain one</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's been a while since I wrote this post, but thanks to Jonathan Schwartz's recent post - <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/step_one_adoption">Technology Adoption (2 of 4)</a> - this post has suddenly become a lot more popular.  I can confirm I am now running ALL of my sites on Joyent on OpenSolaris and I can say I'm very very impressed with the performance and reliability.</p>
