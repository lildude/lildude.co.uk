<p>Just pushed out a little update to HB-Cumulus.  This update is purely for the Habari SVN compatible version of the plugin as all it does is add support for blocks. With the pending release of Habari 0.7, I don't envisage there will be any more updates to the 0.6 compatible version of the plugin.</p>
