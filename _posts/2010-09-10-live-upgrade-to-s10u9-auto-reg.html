<p>With the release of Solaris 10 9/10 many people will be downloading and setting up their environments to perform the upgrade and installs of this new release.  As you may know by now, Solaris 10 9/10 now has <a href="https://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/821-1907/autoreg" target="_blank">Oracle Solaris Auto Registration</a> functionality.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my release post and referred to the new auto_reg keyword for the <code>sysidcfg</code> used for installing a system via jumpstart.  What I didn't mention was this auto registration information is also needed when performing a live upgrade.</p>
<p>If you attempt to perform a live upgrade as you did previously, without supplying the auto-reg info, you'll see something like this:</p>
<div class="terminal"># luupgrade -n S10U9 -u -s /mnt
<p>System has findroot enabled GRUB<br />
No entry for BE &lt;S10U9&gt; in GRUB menu<br />
Copying failsafe kernel from media.<br />
61364 blocks<br />
miniroot filesystem is &lt;lofs&gt;<br />
Mounting miniroot at &lt;/mnt/Solaris_10/Tools/Boot&gt;<br />
ERROR: The auto registration file &lt;&gt; does not exist or incomplete.<br />
       The auto registration file is mandatory for this upgrade.<br />
       Use -k &lt;filename&gt; argument along with luupgrade command.<br />
#</p></div>
<p>As the message states, you need to specify the<code> -k &lt;filename&gt;</code> argument where <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is a <code>sysidcfg</code> format file containing the auto-reg information exactly as you would put it in the <code>sysidcfg</code> file. This is documented in the <code>luupgrade</code> man page:</p>
<pre>
 -k autoreg_file     Path  to  auto-registration  information
                     file.  See  sysidcfg(4)  for  a  list of
                     valid keywords for use in this file.
</pre>
<p>So in order to perform your live upgrade, you need to pass in the auto-reg information live upgrade is expecting, by either providing the <a href="https://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/821-1909/autoreg1" target="_blank">full details</a> (recommended) or disable auto-reg using a very minimal <code>sysidcfg</code> file:</p>
<div class="terminal">
# echo "auto_reg=disable" > /tmp/sysidcfg<br />
# luupgrade -n S10U9 -u -s /mnt -k /tmp/sysidcfg
</div>
