<p>Cooool.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/xcode.html">Mac OS X Leopard will have DTrace</a> built into it when it's released.  Now I can debug the crap performance I get on my Mac every once in a while the Solaris way.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Check out Bryan Cantrill's <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=dtrace_on_mac_os_x">blog entry</a> for a more details. Looks like it won't be a crippled implementation either.</p>
