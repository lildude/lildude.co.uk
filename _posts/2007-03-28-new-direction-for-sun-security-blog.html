<p>The <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/security/">Sun Security Blog</a> has been running for some time, however it didn't really have much content other than regular updates of new security alerts. Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>Following a lot of internal discussion following the infamous telnetd issue that occurred a couple of months ago, it has been decided to actually use this blog for more security related information.  From the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/security/entry/a_new_direction_for_blogs">recent posting</a> about the forth coming changes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, here at <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/security/">blogs.sun.com/security</a> we hope to provide a point of consolidation, where people can find postings and feeds pertinent to their preferred topics - Security Alerts, Tips, New Products, Announcements of "Pertinent Stuff" internal and external to Sun - where you can find personally written content with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and where you can have conversations through comments, cross-linking, providing the immediacy which is a cornerstone of the modern web.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also plans for better integration with <a href="http://www.sun.com/security/">http://www.sun.com/security/</a>.  Soon we'll have a one-stop shot for security related information.  Whilst most of it will be pertinent to Solaris/OpenSolaris, if it's anything like the internal security alias, there'll be a lot that isn't directly related too.</p>
<p>If you're interested in security, particularly to do with Solaris/OpenSolaris, then be sure to pop by regularly, or just subscribe to the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/security/feed/entries/rss">feed</a>.</p>
