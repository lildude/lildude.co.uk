<p>At some insane hour this morning, the first milestone of <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/">Project Indiana</a>,  was made publicly available. Whilst this isn't the official release of Project Indiana, it does give you a very good idea of what to expect when it is released.</p>
<p>To quote the OpenSolaris forum <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=43372&tstart=0">announcement</a>:</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
<blockquote>This is an x86-based LiveCD install image, containing some new and emerging OpenSolaris technologies. This may result in instabilities that lead to system panics or data corruption.</p>
<p>Among the features contained in this release are</p>
<ul>
<li>Single CD download, with LiveCD 'try before you install' capabilities</li>
<li>Caiman installer, with significantly improved installation experience</li>
<li>ZFS as the default filesystem</li>
<li>Image packaging system, with capabilities to pull packages from network repositories</li>
<li>GNU utilities in the default $PATH</li>
<li>bash as the default shell</li>
<li>GNOME 2.20 desktop environment</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you keen on seeing what Project Indiana is all about, <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/getit/">go grab a copy of the ISO</a> and start testing.  If you hit a bug, <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/reporting_bugs/">report it</a> - remember, if you don't report a bug for a problem, no matter how small, it won't ever be fixed.</p>
<p>After you have installed the OpenSolaris OS on your system, try out some of the new functionality including downloading and installing applications using the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/documents/">new IPS</a> (think apt-get) or roll your own OpenSolaris distro using the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/caiman/Constructor/DC_docs/getstarted">Distribution Constructor Toolkit</a>.</p>
