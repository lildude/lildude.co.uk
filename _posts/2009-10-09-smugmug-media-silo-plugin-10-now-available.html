<p>Well, folks, it's taken a long time but I can now finally and proudly announce that my <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/smugmug-media-silo-plugin/">SmugMug Media Silo plugin</a> for <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a> is now available for download.</p>
<p>The SmugMug Media Silo plugin implements a Habari media silo to access your <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> photos making it easy to insert images into posts and pages.  You can also upload images directly to SmugMug from the Habari admin interface.</p>
<p>You can find more details on what this plugin can do, and download it from the <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/smugmug-media-silo-plugin/">project page</a>.</p>
<p>If you encounter any problems, please feel free to let me know in this post and I'll endeavour to resolve any issues as quickly as possible.</p>
