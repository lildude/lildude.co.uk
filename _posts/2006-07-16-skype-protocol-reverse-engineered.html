<p>I was quite pleased to find out that the protocol Skype use for their VoIP application has been <a href="http://www.voipwiki.com/blog/?p=16">reverse engineered</a>, however I'm still not convinced about Skype.  Yes they were the first to jump on the VoIP bandwagon, however they chose not to use SIP or any other open protocol.  Hopefully this reverse engineering will pave the way for a bit more competition for Skype and thus lower prices to non-Skype network calls. Anyone know of a good SIP VoIP provider in the UK that is cheap?</p>
