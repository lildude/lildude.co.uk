<p>Help!  Anyone have any idea what has caused the Chome application icons in the address bar to start looking like this:</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Deformed Chrome App Icons" src="/assets/ChromeAppIcons.png" width="348" height="75" /></p>
<p>I fired up my browser yesterday and this is what they look like now. Any ideas on how to fix it?</p>
<p>Some useful, I'm running Chrome 19.0.1077.3 dev on Mac OS X 10.7.3</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Well, I really should have tried harder before posting.  Minutes after posting the above, I changed my search terms slightly and bingo, I found this appears to be a known (and <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/dev-channel-update_23.html" target="_blank">documented</a>) bug (Issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118755" target="_blank">#118755</a>) introduced with the 19.0.1077.3 update.</p>
