<p>OpenSolaris 2008.11 RC was <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-announce/2008-November/001967.html">pushed out late Friday</a> evening, so time to get updating. </p>
<p>One of the most notable bug fixes is the larger than expected memory requirements that <a href="/opensolaris-200811-release-candidate">RC1</a> had (<a href="http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=3597">bug 3597</a>).</p>
<p>There is also an automated installer image so you can get experimenting with the new <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/caiman/auto_install/Documentation/">automated installer functionality</a> (aka Jumpstart for OpenSolaris) that will become available for the first time with OpenSolaris 2008.11.</p>
