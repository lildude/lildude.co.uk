<p>I've just discovered an annoying "feature" of the Ubuntu Unity Launcher: it tries to be too clever for it's own good.</p>
<p>When working, I use two distinct Firefox instances with different profiles in each.  This is so I can have work specific bookmarks etc separate from the bookmarks I use for non-work stuff which are synced across all my computers.</p>
<p>To make it easy to fire up these two distinct Firefox instances, I created two application launcher icons on my desktop which both run "<code>firefox -P ProfileName --no-remote</code>" (I leave off the <code>--no-remote</code> for the non-work profile).  Each is given it's own icon so I can distinguish between them easily.  This works a treat and does exactly what I want.</p>
<p>Things however change when you drag these two icons onto the Unity Launcher.  They're distinct and separate whilst you remain logged in for that session, but when you log in later one of the launchers will have changed, and it's usually the work specific launcher.  The icon is changed back to the default Firefox icon and the command is changed too. It's as if the Unity Launcher thinks I'm a complete imbecile and I actually wanted two launchers running the exact same command and looking exactly the same.  Come on, I'm not that stupid.  I've even tried using two uniquely named shell scripts, but the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't a problem that is unique to the Unity Launcher, I had the same problem when adding my shortcuts to the task bar in the previous release too.  This seems to be Ubuntu being too clever for itself and getting it wrong.</p>
