<p>This weekend My Oracle Support was upgraded.  To most people, the change won't be noticeable as very little has changed within the Flash interface.  However, if you're a user of the HTML interface (<a href="http://supporthtml.oracle.com" target="_blank">supporthtml.oracle.com</a>), you'll see a huge change.  Check it out...</p>

<p>The HTML interface is significantly more functional and resembles the Flash interface a lot more.  Over time this will improve even more.</p>
<p>I like this change and will definitely be using the HTML interface from now one (whenever I need to check something from an external point of view).</p>
