Nothing says Friday afternoon like [activating POWER MODE](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) in [Atom](https://atom.io/) and plowing through your last minute commits like you do critters in the RPG game de jour (I'm not a gamer so I have no idea what is on trend at the moment) before the day's out...

It's a little jarring so I don't think I'll be keeping this one enabled for long, but a nice little bit of fun for a Friday afternoon.
