<p>Looks like the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/029738">DoJ are happy for the buyout to go ahead</a>.  Now we just need to see if Larry Ellison gives a monkies about what the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/04/sun_oracle_takeover_concerns/">European Commission has to say on the matter</a>.</p>
