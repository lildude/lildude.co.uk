<p>The latest Live Upgrade patch (<a href="https://getupdates.oracle.com/all_unsigned/121430-81.zip" target="_blank">121430-81</a> / <a href="https://getupdates.oracle.com/all_unsigned/121431-82.zip" target="_blank">121431-82</a>) came out last night and in it we get some nice new functionality: you can now re-initialize your live upgrade configuration in one simple command.</p>
<p>To re-initialize your Live Upgrade configuration, you used to have to run through the process I documented in <a href="https://support.oracle.com/CSP/main/article?cmd=show&type=NOT&id=11417657.1" target="_blank">Doc ID 1417657.1</a>.  With <a href="https://getupdates.oracle.com/all_unsigned/121430-81.zip" target="_blank">121430-81</a> / <a href="https://getupdates.oracle.com/all_unsigned/121431-82.zip" target="_blank">121431-82</a>, you no longer need to follow that document, you can simply use <code>ludelete(1M)</code> with its two new arguments:</p>
<pre>     -R              Delete all the Alternate  Boot Environments 
                     (ABEs) present in the system.
                     Reinstate the system back to a state  where 
                     no ABEs  are present  in the system. The -R 
                     option would  ask for  confirmation  before 
                     proceeding to delete all the ABEs.

     -F              Forceful deletion of a BE even if  it is the
                     last  BE on that disk.   This  option can be 
                     used with a single BE  or with  -R option to 
                     delete  all the ABEs.    When  used with  -R 
                     option, it forcefully deletes all  Alternate 
                     BEs   in the   system   without   asking for 
                     confirmation.</pre>
<p>Unfortunately the <code>lu*(1M)</code> man pages haven't been updated yet, but the above will appear in them when they are updated, probably with different spacing.</p>
<p>So lets take this new functionality for a spin...</p>

<p>So what has this done? It's completely removed all traces of my live upgrade configuration from <code>/etc/lutab</code> (this file is actually deleted) and the files in <code>/etc/lu/</code>.  It has also removed any ZFS datasets directly associated with my boot environments.  It has also updated my OBP aliases (and GRUB if I were using x86) to only show the currently active boot environment.  Essentially my system now looks as it would if you'd never configured Live Upgrade on it.</p>
<p>This is great news and is something we've been wanting for a while now.  Sadly it means my document is now obsolete :-( . Oh well, I'll be writing plenty more.</p>
