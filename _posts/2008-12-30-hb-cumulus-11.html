<p>I've had to push out a minor update to <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus</a> as I've just discovered a little bug which causes the HB-Cumulus settings to be deleted when another plugin is deactivated.</p>
<p>You can get the latest revision from the <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a new release, I've closed comments on the <a href="/announcing-hb-cumulus-10/">1.0 post</a>.  If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.1 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
