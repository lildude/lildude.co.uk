<p>Following a recent update to snv_108, I could no longer get any graphics output on my <a href="https://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/">Ultra 20 M2</a> and subsequent updates weren't helping either.  For some reason the graphics card (onboard nVidia Quadro FX 560) was not being seen correctly by the OS and the only indication of a problem was the following in the <code>/var/log/Xorg.log.0</code>:<br />

Fatal server error:
xf86OpenConsole: Cannot open /dev/fb (No such file or directory)
</pre>
<p>And sure enough, there was no <code>/dev/fb</code> device, or more specifically the device it was pointing to (<code>/devices/pci@0,0/pci10de,377@f/display@0:nvidia0</code>) didn't exist anymore.</p>
<p>The only indication of a possible error was I was now getting "<code>WARNING: PCIE init err info failed BDF 0x0</code>" messages in my messages file, which I wasn't before.</p>
<p>A quick search through the known bugs soon revealed (internally accessible only):</p>
<p>CR ID: 6811922<br />
Synopsis: PCIE init err info failed BDF 0x0 on snv_109 (Ultra 20 M2)</p>
<p>For some reason this has been closed as "Not reproducable", and someone rightly pointed out this shouldn't be the case as it clearly IS reproducable...</p>
<blockquote><p>This bug is marked as Not Reproducible; however, the problem can occur on any machine that's not running firmware > 1.52.</p></blockquote>
<p>My machine only had rev 1.45.0 of the firmware, so I needed to at least update my firmware to clear these PCIE errors, and hopefully fix the issue with the graphics.</p>
<p>Now updating the firmware is a really simple matter: <a href="https://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/downloads.html">download</a> the "Tools and Drivers" ISO image, burn to DVD (as it's about 1.3GB), boot from DVD and select option 2 to perform the update. Assuming you have a DVD burner and free DVD-R on hand.  I didn't so I had to think of another method to perform the update. </p>
<p>And that's just what I did.  See <a href="/howto-update-ultra-20-bios-from-a-usb-stick">HOWTO: Update Ultra 20 BIOS From a USB Stick</a> in which I documented the method I took to create a bootable USB stick from the "Drivers and Tools" DVD ISO image which had just enough on it to perform the BIOS update.</p>
<p>And guess what, it solved my problems: both of them.  It seems there has been a change in the PCI-E software within OpenSolaris that seems to require a later version of BIOS.  Updating the BIOS ensured I met this undocumented/unexpected requirement and now I no longer get the PCIE errors AND my graphics card is recognised and works again.</p>
