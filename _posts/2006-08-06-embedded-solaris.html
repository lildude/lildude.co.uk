<p>Now this has some potential if initiated correctly.  Jim Connors has managed <a href="http://uadmin.blogspot.com/2006/08/poor-mans-thumper.html">to compress Solaris with ZFS support into 30Mb and get it to boot from flash</a>. Could we be seeing Solaris sneaking into embedded devices currently occupied by other OSes?</p>
