<p>Welcome to my new blog.  After causing people to glaze over and start uncontrollably rocking and sucking their thumbs following a bit of technical diatribe, I've decided to start posting all my technical posts and articles on a completely seperate blog (this one) and leave my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk">original</a> for other random non-technical stuff.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the background bit - this site has been built, once again, with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and I'm using a heavily customised version of the <a href="http://www.openswitch.org/2006/04/16/unsleepable/">Unsleepable</a> theme.  One of the big changes I've made is I've made it a flexible/fluid layout, so the content should adjust quite happily to browser resizes.</p>
<p>I'm still tuning and tweaking here and there, improving performance and have a bit more functionality to add, so sit back, <a href="/atom.xml">subscribe</a> and enjoy.  I've got a fair few articles up my sleeve, so watch this space.</p>
