<p>It hasn't taken long for people to trip over this one and I knew I'd see this one coming.  People are finding when trying to boot or install Solaris 11 on relatively old hardware, they are getting output similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="terminal">Rebooting with command: boot cdrom - nowin
Boot device: /pci@1e,600000/pci@0/pci@1/pci@0/ide@1f/cdrom@0,0:f  File and args: - nowin
Error: 'SUNW,UltraSPARC-IIIi' is not supported by this release of Solaris.
Program terminated
{1} ok </pre>
<p>This is because Solaris 11 does NOT include support for any of the UltraSPARC I, II, IIe, III, IIIi, III+, IV and IV+ CPUs as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/end-of-notices/eonsolaris11-392732.html" target="_blank">documented</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>End of Support for Legacy Hardware</p>
<p>Support for legacy systems that have included the UltraSPARC I, II, IIe, III, IIIi, III+, IV and IV+ processor architectures (as reported by the Solaris 'psrinfo -pv' command) has been removed. All Oracle SPARC Enterprise M-Series Servers and Oracle SPARC T-Series Servers will continue to be supported.</p>
<p>Note: Oracle Solaris 10 will continue to be a supported operating system for these affected platforms as per the current Oracle lifetime support policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not privy to the reasoning behind this decision, though I suspect it may have something to do with the end-of-life dates for the hardware involved.</p>
<p>Of course you can continue to run Solaris 10 on these machines as the above states.  You can also run Solaris 11 on x86, but just not 32-bit CPUs as 32-bit kernel support has also been removed in Solaris 11.  32-bit applications will continue to run without change.</p>
