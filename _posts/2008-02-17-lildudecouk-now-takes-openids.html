<p>Well, I've jumped on the bandwagon.  You can now comment using your OpenID instead of specifying a username, password and URI.  Just enter your OpenID URI and post your comment.  Your nickname and email will be obtained from your SREG data saved on your OpenID server. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a side effect of this, I've had to temporarily disable AJAX commenting. I'll fix this one day ;-)</p>
<p>Oh yes, OpenID comments are automatically approved too and will be until spammers start using OpenID.</p>
