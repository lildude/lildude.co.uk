<p>If you've been following the developments of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>, you'll be pleased to hear <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/0-5-released">Habari 0.5 is now out the door</a> and waiting for you to <a href="http://habariproject.org/en/download">download</a> and use.</p>
<p>Habari 0.5 is a vast improvement on the previous stable release (0.4.1) so if you tried 0.4.1 and didn't think much of it, I recommend you give 0.5 a go.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>
