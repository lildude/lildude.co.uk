<p>It's with great delight I read that the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/patch/entry/improvements_to_solaris_10_recommended">Solaris 10 Recommended and SunAlert patch clusters have been improved</a>.  Ed Clark has sat down and finally improved the <code>install_cluster</code> script, now called <code>installcluster</code>, and the cleaned up the directory structure.  The whole build and verification process has been improved too.</p>
<p>The improvements are quite significant and well <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/patch/entry/improvements_to_solaris_10_recommended">detailed</a>, so I'll just summarize the improvements:</p>
<p><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>No more "false negatives" reported for things like patches that already been applied.</li>
<li>Immediate exit when a legitimate error is encountered, ie now one of the old false negatives from above.</li>
<li>New context intelligence for patching operations, thus providing better feedback of what is expected of the administrator.</li>
<li>Improved Live Upgrade integration.  Ensure you read the cluster <code>README</code> for more details on this.</li>
<li>Improved filesystem space checking.</li>
<li>Improved logging. See the <code>README</code> for more details on this.</li>
<li>The <code>patch_order</code> file is now optimised for efficiency and to avoid known issues.</li>
<li>Cleaner directory structure</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a few words of caution...</p>
<ul>
<li>The cluster download is huge, so ensure you are up to date on your zip patches (see Doc <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-62-252447-1">252447</a> for details and patches) before attempting to unzip it.</li>
<li>Patching as part of a jumpstart installation (using the "<code>patch patch_order
<path /></code>" profile line) expects the patch_order file to be in the same directory as the patches themselves.  This isn't the case, so until this bug is fixed, you'll need to remember to copy the patch_order file into the patches subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all the improvements in both the cluster itself and the building and testing procedures look good and this should make administrators' (and support engineers' ;-) ) lives significantly easier when it comes to patching.</p>
