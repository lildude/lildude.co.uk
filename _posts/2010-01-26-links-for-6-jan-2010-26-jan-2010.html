<p>Links of interest for 6 Jan 2010 - 26 Jan 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100121/sun-ceo-go-oracle-internal-memo/">Internal Memo: Sun CEO Jon Schwartz to Staff</a> - I didn't noticed this (I got the original), but these guys did: a little hidden message in Jon's memo. Note how it doesn't apply to the whole memo.  Seems consistent with his efforts as a CEO: He started off well and then couldn't be bothered to finish what he started.</li>
<li><a href="https://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/40&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">EUROPA - Press Releases - Mergers: Commission clears Oracle's proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems</a> - And the official press release.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBFA00103020100121">Oracle wins unconditional EU approval for Sun buy</a> - It's taken long enough, but finally the EU have approved the deal.  I think things will start to move very quickly now.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/lisan/entry/pitfalls_of_benchmarking_flash_with">Pitfalls of Benchmarking Flash with dd(1M) : Lisa Noordergraaf</a> - A great simple illustration of why dd(1M) really isn't a good tool for benchmarking disk performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/mmusante/entry/seven_years_of_good_luck">Spitting ZFS Mirrors</a> - Woohoo!! Finally a highly sought after feature - zfs splitting - has made it into ZFS as of snv_131. Mark provides a bit more insight into this forth coming functionality.</li>
</ul>
