<p>My director and I are presenting the "<a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3042" target="_blank">Get Proactive: Best Practices for Maintaining and Upgrading Oracle Solaris</a>" session on Mon 1 October at 16:45 and we'll also be manning the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/openworld/support-stars-bar/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle Support Stars Bar</a>, so feel free to pop by and say hello.  Of course, you can bring along some questions too ;-) .</p>
<p>If you don't fancy coming to our session or the Stars Bar :-( , I'll also be milling around at the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/us/support/oracle-openworld2012/myos-meetup-overview-1719978.html?msgid=CAMP-LB-SUP_newsletter5" target="_blank">My Oracle Support Community Meet Up </a> event at <a href="https://www.thirstybear.com/" target="_blank">Thirsty Bear Brewing Company</a> sampling the various beers they produce, so feel free to come introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and don't forget there are loads of other <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/focusPDF.do?focusID=21030" target="_blank">Solaris related sessions</a> you can attend whilst you're at OpenWorld.</p>
