<p>I've just released the next revision of <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus</a> - rev 1.5.  </p>
<p>This release now takes full advantage of the new tags functionality in the latest Habari SVN code and also now uses SWFObject 2.2 for the embedding in "non-compatibility" (ie the default) mode.</p>
<p>All the other changes are minor and include things like better HTML validation, formatting of the code itself and an update to the tagcloud flash file itself.</p>
<p>Downloads are on the <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a new release, I've closed comments on the <a href="/hb-cumulus-14/">1.4 post</a>.  If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.5 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
