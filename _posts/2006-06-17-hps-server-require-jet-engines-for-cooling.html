<p>Really - <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=16992&ch=infotech">Hewlett-Packard is adapting fans from radio-controlled jets to relieve heat-stressed computer servers</a>.</p>
<p>In this day and age we can't afford computers to generate much more heat.  We're <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=a_roof_in_midtown_manhattan">running out of roof space</a> to store all the air-con units in inner-city locations, so why are they bothering?  I'd rather save my roof space and cash and go for one of <a href="https://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/">these super cool babies</a>.</p>
