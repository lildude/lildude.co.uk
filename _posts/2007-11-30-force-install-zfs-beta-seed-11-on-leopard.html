<p>It seems there is a packaging bug in the current <a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=19884">ZFS Beta Seed</a> available from the ADC, but thanks to <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving">Shawn Ferry's</a> <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/yakshaving/entry/how_to_get_experimental_rw">jiggery-pokery steps</a>, I've got it installed.
