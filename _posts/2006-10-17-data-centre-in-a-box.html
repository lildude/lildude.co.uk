<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/SunDataCentre.jpg" alt="Data Centre in A Box" />How's this for a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/1700AP_Sun_Data_Center.html">cool idea</a>... Sun is launching this concept project dubbed Project Blackbox today.  It's essentially a "data centre in a box" with all the necessary servers, storage and networking equipment packed into a cushioned and cooled 20-foot-long cargo shipping container.</p>
<p>The big idea behind these is to minimise the gap between the time it takes to build a data centre and the time it takes to actually order and take delivery of the equipment.</p>
<p>Whilst this is a great idea, there is one catch - you could come in to work the next day, not to find <em>part</em> of the kit in your data centre missing, but your <strong>WHOLE</strong> data centre missing.   I hope these come with some great securing methods else they'll be pinched in the blink of an eye.</p>
