<p>I'm a little late on this, but OpenSolaris 2008.11 is now available for all to <a href="https://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/">download</a> and includes loads of new things including <a href="https://opensolaris.org/os/community/on/flag-days/pages/2008092201/">Fast Reboot</a> and a really cool feature - <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/erwann/entry/zfs_on_the_desktop_zfs">Time Slider</a> - aka Time Machine for OpenSolaris, but using ZFS.</p>
