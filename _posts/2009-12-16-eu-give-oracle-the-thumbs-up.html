<p>Woohoo!!! Finally, the <a href="https://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/oracle_sun_day_8JM3CjHrKVL20vtVAMmn4K">EU has given Oracle the thumbs-up</a> for their purchase of Sun...</p>
<blockquote><p>Larry Ellison's Oracle won an all-clear from Europe's top antitrust official to proceed with its $7.4 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems after reaching a verbal agreement to protect a piece of software at the heart of a months-long dispute.</p></blockquote>
<p>The final approval is due mid-January.  I think the EU have done the right thing by approving this deal, not only because I'm a Sun employee (speaking only for myself), but also for the sake of Sun's customers.</p>
