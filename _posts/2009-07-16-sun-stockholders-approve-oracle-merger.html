<p>It's a sad day in the history of Sun Microsystems...</p>
<blockquote><p>SANTA CLARA, CA July 16, 2009 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA) announced that at a special meeting of stockholders held on July 16, 2009, its stockholders adopted the merger agreement entered into with Oracle Corporation, under which Oracle will acquire Sun common stock for $9.50 per share in cash. Approximately 62% of the shares of Sun common stock outstanding as of the record date for the meeting voted to adopt the agreement. (<a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-07/sunflash.20090716.1.xml">Source</a>) </p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of this, Sun Microsystems will be removed from the NASDAQ-100 tomorrow, but will continue to trade on the NASDAQ until the merge is finalised, which is likely to happen pending some major unknown event of regulatory intervention.</p>
