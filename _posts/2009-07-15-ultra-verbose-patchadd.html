<p>Ever wished you could get patchadd(1M) to give you the same verbose output pkgadd(1M) does with the <code>-v</code> option?  Well believe it or not, you can, it's just not documented.</p>
<p>I was perusing through the <code>/usr/lib/patch/patchadd</code>  script on Solaris 10 and look what I found...</p>
<pre>
function parse_args
{
        [...]
      	-g) PKGADD_DEBUG="yes"; shift;;
        [...]
}
</pre>
<p>This option isn't documented anywhere, however I do know modifying this script and manually setting this PKGADD_DEBUG variable to yes/true gives you output equivalent to "<code>pkgadd -v</code>" which the pkgadd(1M) man page explains...</p>
<pre>     -v

         Trace all of the scripts that get  executed  by  pkgadd,
         located in the pkginst/install directory. This option is
         used for debugging  the  procedural  and  non-procedural
         scripts.</pre>
<p>Sure enough, passing the <code>-g</code> option to patchadd(1M) gives us the same output, without having to modify the <code>/usr/lib/patch/patchadd</code> script itself.</p>
<p>I did a bit more investigating and this option has been in this (or equivalent) script since Solaris 8 without any public knowledge of it.</p>
<p>Now this is going to become a very useful option when debugging patches that fail to install where the logs end up being next to useless. I just wish I'd known about it sooner.</p>
