<p>Thanks to some good feedback and testing by the chaps in the Habari community, I've pushed out a small minor update to my <a href="/projects/hb-audio-player/">HB Audio Player plugin</a> which fixes some misbehaviour seen when your theme doesn't use a <code>style.css</code> file in the theme's base directory. From now on, HB  Audio Player will only show a "Theme Colours" selection tool if it's managed to successfully locate a <code>style.css</code> file in your theme's base directory and it's found some colours in this file.</p>
<p>I've also updated the download filename for the Habari SVN compatible release by using "svn" to indicate the Habari revision instead of "0.7" (as 0.7 doesn't exist yet).</p>
<p>As this is a new release, Iâ€™ve closed comments on the <a href="/hb-audio-player-10-now-available/">1.0 post</a>. If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.1 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
