<p>Links of interest for 11 September 2007 - 27 September 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plaintxt.org/2006/06/13/the-best-minimalist-wordpress-themes/">The Best Minimalist WordPress Themes &middot; plaintxt.org</a> - Some of the best minimalist themes I've seen.</li>
<li><a href="https://immike.net/blog/2007/08/15/5-tools-every-php-programmer-should-know-about/#more-102">5 tools every PHP programmer should know about</a> - Some very interesting tools here.  Can't say I'd have a use for all of them, but certainly a few.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/26/sun_x86_play/">It's time to pay attention to Sun's x86 server biz</a> - This can only bode well for Sun if The Register is praising it's new x86 machines.  A lot of potential Sun customer's read El Reg, so this is a nice bit of free advertising. Lets hope it turns into some large sales.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html">7 reasons I switched back to PHP after 2 years on Rails</a> - Quite an interesting story.  I started looking into Rails, but never actually got so far as to considering replacing my trusted PHP. I think I'll hold off for the moment.  Maybe Rails will be perfect for a future project of mine.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.justlinux.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=147959">How to install and boot 145 operating systems in a PC</a> - Someone has far too much free time.  145 Operating Systems on one PC is incredible. I wouldn't want the task of rebuilding that when the disk fails.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/opensolaris_vs_gnulinux_deathm.html">OpenSolaris vs. GNU/Linux: Deathmatch or Lovefest?</a> - Good question. Only time will tell.  I'd like to think OpenSolaris will give Linux a run for it's money and win, but I'm slightly biased.</li>
</ul>
