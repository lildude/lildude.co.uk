<p>Just a quick note to let you know that I'm working this weekend, so I'm taking this opportunity to move my sites from the FreeBSD servers at Joyent to their new OpenSolaris servers.  In theory, things should happen smoothly, and you won't notice anything.  But if you do notice any issues, don't worry.  They should all be resolved by 7pm GMT on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: If you see this, then the migration is complete.  Please let me know if you spot any problems.</p>
