<p>Are you still a bit sceptical about running your business on <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> - a free and power operating system, which due to it's development status is technically unsupported (cos you can't pay for the support)?  Well, don't be.  <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyant</a> run on OpenSolaris and <strong>do</strong> encounter problems, however they get them fixed, and quickly too. Check out <a href="http://cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=780">Benr's recent post on their experience when encountering problems on OpenSolaris</a>.  </p>
<p>Can you do this with any other operating system? I don't think so.</p>
