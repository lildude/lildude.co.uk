<p>Fyodor (writer of <a href="https://www.insecure.org/">nmap</a>) has done it again.  He's asked the members of the <a href="https://seclists.org/#nmap-hackers">nmap-hackers</a> mail list to share their favourite security tools.  This year Fyodor has devoted a <a href="https://sectools.org/">whole site to the 2006 results</a>.  It's a very interesting read and has some pretty cool tools, some of which I've never heard of before.</p>
