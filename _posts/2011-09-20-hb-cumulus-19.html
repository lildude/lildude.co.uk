<p>Well, it's been a week since I implemented my changes to the <code>tagcloud.swf</code> and I've not encountered any problems.  I've also been in touch with MustLive who reported <a href="/security-vulnerabilities-in-hb-cumulus-14-and-lower">the original XSS and HTML Injection issues I mentioned last week</a> and he believes my changes successfully mitigate the HTML Injection issue.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I'm pleased to announce <a href="https://github.com/lildude/HB-Cumulus">HB-Cumulus 1.9</a> as the latest revision of HB-Cumulus and for a limited time only, it is the <strong>ONLY</strong> port of WP-Cumulus that is NOT vulnerable to the HTML Injection issue.</p>
<p>I'm in the process of writing up my changes and I'll feed them back to Roy so he can fix WP-Cumulus and in doing so, fix all the other ports where the authors, like Roy, couldn't be bothered to look into this issue themselves.  I need to be quick this this though as my trial Flash CS5 license is about to expire :-)</p>
