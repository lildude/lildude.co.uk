<p>Wooohooo!!! After working for Sun for over 6 years, I've finally got my first hardware upgrade:</p>

<p>Impressive hey?  We must be finally making some money. I've gone from a Type 6 mouse  to a Type 7 optical with scroll wheel on my Sunray DTU.  Unfortunately, the Ultra10 under my desk still limps along without any sign of an upgrade or replacement (hence I use the Sunray for most of my work).</p>
