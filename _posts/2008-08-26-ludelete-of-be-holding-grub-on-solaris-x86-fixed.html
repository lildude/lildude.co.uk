<p>My little Ultra 20 under my desk runs with two boot environments and flip-flop between them as I upgrade using Live Upgrade.  The basic procedure is: rename the old inactive BE (lurename), update it with the contents of the currently running BE (lumake), upgrade it to the latest and greatest (luupgrade), activate it (luactivate) and reboot.</p>
<p>This is quite a pain free experience and has worked well for me.  I never actually delete the alternate BE as I don't need the space.  However, other people need to and ever since GRUB was introduced into Solaris 10 (x86 only) they encounter the following error when attempting to delete the BE that contains the GRUB menu:</p>
<div class="terminal">
# ludelete -n snv_22<br />
ERROR: The boot environment <snv_22> contains the GRUB menu.<br />
ERROR: You are not allowed to delete this BE.<br />
Unable to delete boot environment.<br />
#</snv_22></div>
<p>This is a long standing issue (I've got a workaround if you want it) that has plagued many a sysadmin using Live Upgrade on Solaris 10 x86 and Nevada.  Well, not any more.</p>
<p><!--more-->This morning I decided I'd upgrade from snv_94 to snv_96 and I hit a hurdle on the first command - the lurename.  I was presented with this message:</p>
<div class="terminal">
# lurename -e snv_88 -n snv_96        </p>
<p>This system contains only a single GRUB menu for all boot environments. To<br />
enhance reliability and improve the user experience, live upgrade requires<br />
you to run a one time conversion script to migrate the system to multiple<br />
redundant GRUB menus. This is a one time procedure and you will not be<br />
required to run this script on subsequent invocations of Live Upgrade<br />
commands. To run this script invoke:</p>
<p>   /usr/lib/lu/lux86menu_propagate /path/to/new/Solaris/install/image</p>
<p>		where /path/to/new/Solaris/install/image is an absolute<br />
path to the Solaris media or netinstall image from which you installed the<br />
Live Upgrade packages.</p>

<p>I know this is sad, but I got a little excited.  Finally they've resolved the ludelete and GRUB issue in Nevada. Wooohooo!!!!</p>
<p>So I did as instructed...</p>

<p>Done. And comparison of the two menu.lst file indicates we've got two identical GRUB menus - one in each of my BEs, which means I'll be able to delete any one of them, if I so wish.</p>
<div class="terminal">
# luumount snv_88<br />
# lumount snv_88<br />
/.alt.snv_88<br />
# diff /boot/grub/menu.lst /.alt.snv_88/boot/grub/menu.lst<br />
No differences encountered<br />
#</div>
<p>Finally!!! Live Upgrade on Solaris x86 is fixed and should now work as it does on SPARC - ie without any problems or having to jump through hoops.</p>
<p>Apparently, this issue is due to be resolved in Solaris 10 update 6 when it's released later this year.</p>
