<p>I can say I am now a <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scsa.xml">Sun Certified System Administrator (SCSA) for Solaris 10</a>.  I did the Solaris 8 certification years ago, and have just popped down and whizzed through the upgrade test. I didn't need to study for this one, but will for the <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scna.xml">Networking</a> and <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scseca.xml">Security</a> certifications which are next on my list.</p>
