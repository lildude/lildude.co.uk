<p>Solaris 10 11/06 (aka Update 3) is now available for download from the Sun Download site.  <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/get.jsp">Go grab it now</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you are using zones today and plan to upgrade to Solaris 10 11/06, please read the answer to the question "How do I upgrade a system with zones installed?" in the zones FAQ: <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zones/faq/#sa_upgrade">http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zones/faq/#sa_upgrade</a> . The information there includes a warning about an incorrect error message which may appear during the upgrade, as well as a potential real problem and a work-around.</p>
<p>The information is also included in the 11/06 release notes, but I thought I'd mention  it.</p>
