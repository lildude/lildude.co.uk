<p>So Twitter announced yesterday that they have now <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/getting-started-login-verification" target="_blank">enabled optional two-factor authentication</a>.  "Great!" you may think, but think again... it seems Twitter has gone their own way and made it a right PITA to use.  Ars Technica summarise it nicely...</p>
<blockquote cite="https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/twitter-launches-two-factor-authentication-too-late-to-save-the-onion/"><p>Like Google's two-factor authentication, Twitter's login verification sends a code via SMS to be entered to confirm login. But unlike Google's system, the code will be sent <strong><em>every time</em></strong> users sign into Twitter through its website. This is the case even if it's from a computer or device that they've logged in from before. The phone has to be enrolled through <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14589-how-to-add-your-phone-via-sms" target="_blank">Twitter's existing SMS</a> service first—you have to text a code to Twitter to verify the phone first, which may not work with some phone carriers. The relationship between phones and accounts is also strictly one-to-one: if you have a shared business account, you're going to need to share a phone number too. If you have multiple accounts and only one phone number, then you can only secure a single account.</p>
<p>There are some additional limitations to Twitter's scheme. Other mobile devices and applications (such as HootSuite and TweetDeck) will have to be configured individually as they're added, using a temporary password generated through <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications" target="_blank">Twitter's applications page</a> to be authorized on first login. Unlike the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238" target="_blank">RFC 6238</a> scheme used by Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, there's no way to use standard, generic authentication apps to generate time-based, one-time passwords. So if you can't get the SMS, you're out of luck. And unlike those systems, there's no facility to create persistent application-specific passwords.<br />

<p>Whilst enabling two-factor authentication is a great idea, I think their implementation may put off quite a few people.  We'll see.</p>
