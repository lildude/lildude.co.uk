<p>You've got to love the joke that is software patents and the associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">trolling</a> that has come of late.  As you may have heard by now, <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/09/05/2220228.shtml">NetApp have filed a suit claiming Sun are infringing on some of their patents with ZFS</a>.</p>
<p>Dave Hitz of NetApp <a href="http://blogs.netapp.com/dave/2007/09/netapp-sues-sun.html">details their side of things on his blog</a>. </p>
<p>I'm a bit skeptical of all these claims and, like many believe this may be a desperate attempt to quash a competitor's superior product.  The thing that strikes me most as this being another "patent trolling" case is where they've files the suit -  Lufkin, TX.  Erm, surely if NetApp believed they have that much of a case, they would have filed suit in their hometown (Sunnyvale, CA) or Sun's (Santa Clara, CA), not Lufkin, TX - a known haven for patent trolls.</p>
<p>It already gives you something to think about without actually delving into the facts or hearing Sun's side of things.</p>
<p>As has become characteristic of late, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/on_patent_trolling">Jonathan Schwartz has responded with a blog entry</a> of his own, clearing up the Sun side of things.</p>
<p>Now how much more do you need to convince you that this may be yet another pointless patent case, wasting investors' money? I think Dave and Jonathan should sit down over a couple of beers and sort it out as <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=846">suggested by Ben Rockwood</a>.</p>
