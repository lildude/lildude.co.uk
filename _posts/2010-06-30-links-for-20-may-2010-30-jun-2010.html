<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/patch/entry/merging_the_solaris_recommended_and">Merging the Solaris Recommended and Sun Alert Patch Clusters - Patch Corner</a> - Take note peeps. I can predict I'll be having this discussion with many customers in June.</li>
<li><a href="https://opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=129511&amp;tstart=0">OpenSolaris Forums : An Important Message From Oracle</a> - Looks like the ball may finally be starting to roll with Oracle and OpenSolaris.  Looks like Oracle may have some big plans up it's sleeves and we'll find out more in the next few weeks.</li>
