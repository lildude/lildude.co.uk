<p><a href="https://opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=66391&tstart=0&start=0">OpenSolaris has now been updated to build 93</a>, which I believe is actually the preview build for OpenSolaris 2008.11 (though this may change), and best of all ISOs are being generated again and are available via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you still can't update via the Package Manager so you need to update via the CLI as before, but be sure to update your IPS software revision first, just to be safe.</p>
<p>You can find full update details and download the torrent files in the <a href="https://opensolaris.org/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=66391&tstart=0&start=0">announcement post</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst you're performing the update, check out these two reviews on the features you can expect in this update.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=opensolaris_200811_early&num=1">An Early Look At OpenSolaris 2008.11</a> - This is your usual desktop perspective review.</li>
<li><a href="https://elektronkind.org/2008/07/opensolaris-2008-11-storage">OpenSolaris 2008.11 - A Preview For The Storage Admin</a> - I think this is a great review of features sysadmins want from a Storage perspective, but no one actually bothers reviewing (probably because they don't know, or it's not sensational enough).</li>
