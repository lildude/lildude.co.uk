<p>I've been using NetBeans as my primary IDE for several years now, and I've just had a "<em>But of course.  Don't I feel stupid</em>" moment.  I've just discovered NetBeans (I'm using 6.9.1) DOES do split screen editing and I discovered it by mistake.</p>
<p>So how do you do it?  Simple, drag the tab to the location in the window where you want to view the file...</p>

<p>Once split, you can then resize to suit your needs and even split each of the individual panes further.</p>
<p>You can drag the tab to the top or bottom of the window to get a top-bottom split.  If you want to reverse the split, just drag the tab back to the tab bar. </p>
<p>It would be great if you could do this with a simple keyboard shortcut, but sadly I can't find one at the moment.</p>
