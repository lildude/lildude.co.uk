<p>Watch <a href="https://www.sun.com/investors">this space</a> at 13:00 Pacific Time (20:00 GMT) for news of Sun's FY07 results. This will be the first place the results will be published BEFORE anywhere else and will be the <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/truly_fair_disclosure">first for Sun</a>, and maybe even the world. Hopefully Sun will be hitting that profit it's been promising for so long.</p>
