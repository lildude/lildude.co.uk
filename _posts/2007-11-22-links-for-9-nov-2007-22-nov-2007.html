<p>Links of interest for 9 Nov 2007 - 22 Nov 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/11/16/google-as-a-password-cracker/">Google as a password cracker</a> - Another good use for Google - password cracking.  Ok, it's not true passpord cracking, but rather MD5 hash pattern matching.</li>
<li><a href="https://joyeur.com/2007/11/22/cloud-computing-infrastructure-for-facebook-developers-on-dell-servers-what-does-it-mean">Cloud Computing Infrastructure for Facebook Developers on Dell Servers. What does it mean?</a> - I'm a very disappointed in Sun here.  Joyent are probably the best known OpenSolaris users, and yet Sun couldn't pull finger and treat them with the care they deserve. Come on Jonathan, sort it out.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t103382.html">Porting Open Source Java to Leopard</a> - Wow.  That didn't take long and is a sign open sourcing Java was a good idea.  Pity Apple haven't contributed to the work yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn12912-synchronised-shaking-connects-gadgets-securely.html">Synchronised shaking connects gadgets securely</a> - Shake-n-sync. What a novel idea, but it's usage is going to be pretty limited - limited to devices that can easily be shaken by hand.</li>
<li><a href="https://sendreceivereply.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/i-trace-you-trace-what-about-dtrace/">I trace, you trace ? what about dtrace?</a> - Dtrace is now available on QNX too. Coool.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;265244764;fp;2;fpid;2">Experimental container support for Linux 2.6.24</a> - What's that expression... oh yes, "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery".  Looks like Linux likes what Solaris has got, and wants some of the pie too.</li>
</ul>
