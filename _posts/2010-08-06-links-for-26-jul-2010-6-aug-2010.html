<p>Links of interest for 26 Jul 2010 - 6 Aug 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/solarisadmin/solaris10securitychallenges-163842.pdf">Using Oracle&reg; Solaris 10 to   Overcome Security Challenges</a> - A great whitepaper that briefly explains and demonstrates a lot of the great security features Solaris has.  This isn't a HOWTO, but more of a &quot;look what we can do document&quot;.  Well worth a read, even if you are a seasoned Solaris expert - you may just find a &quot;I didn't know that&quot; moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">Official Google Blog: Update on Google Wave</a> - Good-bye Wave.  I used you once to see what the fuss was all about and then promptly forgot you.  Seems I wasn't the only one who couldn't find a use for it.</li>
<li><a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/07/28/2121259/Oracles-Java-Company-Change-Breaks-Eclipse?from=rss">Slashdot IT Story | Oracle's Java Company Change Breaks Eclipse</a> - And this is why you should NOT rely on string parsing to determine product versions etc.  Use a documented interface, which in this case did NOT change. Had Eclipse done things properly, this post would never have been written.</li>
