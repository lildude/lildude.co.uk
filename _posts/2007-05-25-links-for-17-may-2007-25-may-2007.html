<p>Links of interest for 17 May 2007 - 25 May 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/scripts/sunScripts/zfs_completion.bash.txt">ZFS Auto Completion for Bash</a> - Now you can get ZFS auto completion for Bash with this script.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.com.com/Promising%20antispam%20technique%20gets%20nod/2100-1029_3-6185904.html?part=rss">Promising antispam technique gets nod</a> - Great idea, but it's biggest caveat is the fact it requires both sending and receiving mail servers to have this configured and enabled. Many companies won't be upgrading as soon as this becomes official.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news98962171.html">A Mighty Number Falls</a> - Whilst 1024-bit RSA hasn't actually been defeated, it does give us an indication as to it's impending demise.</li>
<li><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/aix/6/preview.html">IBM AIX 6: Previewing AIX 6 and open beta program</a> - This looks remarkably like a "Me too" release.  Most of this stuff is already available in Solaris/OpenSolaris</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/16/sun_repurchase/">Sun Climbs Buyback Mountain</a> - Woohoo!!! Now my shares might actually start to be worth something.</li>
</ul>
