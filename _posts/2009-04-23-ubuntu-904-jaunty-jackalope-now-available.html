<p>Whilst I'm primarily a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>/<a href="http://www.opensolaris.com">OpenSolaris</a> man, I do like to keep myself in touch with the Linux world - partly out of necessity and partly out of curiosity. I run <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (sticking with my African roots and because it's the best distro I've used) on my very very very old laptop (need) and also within <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> on my Mac (curiosity).</p>
<p>Well, it's that time of year again: it's time to update to the latest and greatest as Jaunty Jackalope is now ready for all to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">download</a>, install and enjoy.</p>
<p>Along with the usual latest and greatest features, I'm particularly interested in seeing if a) the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-netbook">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a> edition actually installs on my aging laptop (it's not a netbook) and b) how well it runs if it does - I currently use Xubuntu as Gnome is a bit sluggish on the old girl, and I don't like KDE.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted on how it goes.</p>
