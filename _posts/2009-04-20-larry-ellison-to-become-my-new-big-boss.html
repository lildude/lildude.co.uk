<p>If all goes well, it looks like Larry Ellison is soon to become my new Big Boss following the news that <a href="https://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> has <a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB124022726514434703.html">agreed to buy</a> <a href="https://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> for the sum of $9.50 a share (I got <a href="https://eclipse.sys-con.com/node/926256">this email</a> too). </p>
<p>I must say I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of Oracle, a software company, acquiring Sun than I was with the idea IBM.  I've never liked the way IBM does business - maybe this is a hand-me-down from my father who used to work for ICL many years ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, Oracle has quite a reputation for integrating acquisitions quickly so it'll be interesting to see how quickly this gets through all the legal ramifications and for Sun to become Oracle (or Sunacle?) in day-to-day business.  It'll also be interesting to see what they do with Sun's land assets.  Whilst I like my current office in Camberley, the trip to Reading where Oracle UK HQ is, is a much easier drive.</p>
<p>It'll also be very interesting to see the direction Oracle takes things like Java, Solaris/OpenSolaris and Sun's hardware line.  Only time will tell.</p>
