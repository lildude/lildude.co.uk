<p>I've made a small update to phpSmug by changing the way images_uploadFromURL() works.  It now uses the API directly and ensures SmugMug effectively does all the hard work. It's a lot more efficient than before. Grab 1.0.2 from the <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/phpsmug/">project page</a>.</p>
