<p>Well, I've only had the Habari source installed for less than a week and I've already contributed and helped to resolve a bug (<a href="https://trac.habariproject.org/habari/ticket/182">#182</a>).  The Habari guys, in this case <a href="https://moeffju.net/">moeffju</a>, are pretty damn quick at sorting things like this out if you're able to actively work with them via IRC and using SVN.  I think I'm going to enjoy using Habari.  </p>
<p>Now the SVN works without the need for me to make any changes, I think I'll start working towards migrating my sites across.  First I need to add some sub-page functionality though.</p>
