<p>Well folks, today was my last day - well, actually half day - working for Oracle. I'm off to pastures new.</p>
<p>I started working for Sun Microsystems way back in January 2001, stuck through the highs and lows and the Oracle acquisition, but now I must move on.  An opportunity has come up I just can't refuse (thanks Michael).</p>
<p>I formally announced my departure to my colleagues on Monday morning, UK time, and I think someone leaked it to the press ;-)... check what the Oracle stock price has done since Monday...</p>

<figcaption>Definite downward trend. Just as well I sold last week at $35.25</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wonder what it's like to be so important for such news to really have an impact on the stock price, maybe I'll find out one day :-)</p>
<p><img class="alignright" alt="MOS Guru" src="/assets/MOS-guru.png" width="90" height="120" />My new job doesn't involve Solaris (more details on what I'll be doing coming soon), but fear not: I plan to keep my grubby mitts in the Solaris pie for the foreseeable future, if only on a personal usage level, so I'll still be posting Solaris related stuff here, along with other new and exciting things.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, leaving Oracle and not using Solaris full time also means I won't be in the <a href="http://communities.oracle.com" target="_blank">My Oracle Support Communities</a> anymore.  I'm bowing out with an incredible 6075 points (this may go up in the next few days as people mark my answers as helpful or correct) and in <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/user/sites/lildude.co.uk/files/2013/12/MOS-gurus-table.png">10th place overall in ALL of the Oracle Communities</a>, which isn't bad for nearly 4 year's work.  I'll probably frequent the <a href="https://forums.oracle.com" target="_blank">OTN Forums</a> instead from now on.</p>
<p>I'm now sitting at home writing this out feeling a little sad, a little happy, a little excited, a little scared, a little woozy (I really shouldn't have eaten those Krispy Kremes I got everyone) and I have a bit of an empty feeling.  Sun/Oracle was a huge chunk of my life and now it's all over.  </p>
<p>Oh well, onto new ventures.  I'm about to embark on one of the most exciting and yet scary times of my life.  I can't wait.</p>
