<p>I hope you haven't forgotten: Today is Firefox 3 download day.  Head on over and download Firefox 3 for your platform and be a part of history.  Help set the new world record for the most downloads in one day.</p>
<p>As of 10am US <acronym title="Pacific Daylight Time">PDT</acronym> (18:00 GMT/UTC) you can grab your downloads from <a href="https://getfirefox.com/">GetFirefox.com</a>, <del datetime="2008-06-17T15:13:30+00:00">and there should be a Solaris version available too</del>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I've just heard on the internal aliases that there won't be a Solaris/OpenSolaris build available or included in the world record stats.  Apparently it's got to do with some strict restrictions by Guinness.  I suspect it's probably because the Solaris/OpenSolaris builds are contributed builds, not official builds.</p>
