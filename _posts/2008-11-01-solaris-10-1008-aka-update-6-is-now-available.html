<p>Sun managed to only just get Solaris 10 10/08 out in time to still call it the 10/08 release.  It was released to the public yesterday and is available for <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/get.jsp">download</a> now.</p>
<p>So why do you want this release? Well for a lot of good reasons.  I'm not going to list them all as the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-0547/ghgdx?l=de&a=view">Solaris 10 10/08 release notes</a> do that job, but instead I'll highlight some of the features I think are great/useful/long coming:</p>
<p><!--more-->
<ul>
<li>ZFS Root filesystems - see my <a href="/howto-migrate-a-ufs-root-filesystem-to-zfs/">HOWTO: Migrate a UFS Root Filesystem to ZFS</a> post</li>
<li>ZFS failmode property - wait, continue or panic in case of catastrophic pool failure.  This is very useful for systems which use only a single SAN LUN for all ZFS storage.  Now your system will only panic if you want it to.</li>
<li>ZFS Hot-Plug support - hands-free disk auto-replacement</li>
<li>ZFS GZIP compression - for those who need even better compression, but don't mind the slight speed impact</li>
<li>Zones Update on Attach - now you can update (can't "down-date") a zone to the OS patch/release of the host it's being attached to.  Can also use this to migrate between sun4u and sun4v archs. </li>
<li>Ability to Set Default Router in Shared-IP Zone - this one has been demanded for a long time</li>
<li>x86: New GRUB findroot Command - now you can <a href="/ludelete-of-be-holding-grub-on-solaris-x86-fixed/">ludelete the first boot env that holds GRUB</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot more new things and a lot more enhancements too.  As I said above, check the release notes for all the details and then get updating, using Live Upgrade naturally.</p>
