<p>If you're ever had concerns about the effect of noise on your disk performance, let <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/brendan/">Brendan Gregg</a> put your mind at rest.  Thanks to the brilliant <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/bmc/resource/cec_analytics.pdf">Analytics</a> (aka Dtrace with a brilliant web interface) on the a <a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/7410/">Sun Storage 7410</a> we can clearly see noise does have an effect, and in this extreme case (don't try this at <del title="There's no way you've got one of these at home">home</del> work), quite a large effect:</p>
<div class="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tDacjrSCeq4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1&showsearch=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/tDacjrSCeq4&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1&showsearch=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344" /></object></div>
<p>Now that is cool.  Lets see NetApp or EMC show us that kind of real time proof.</p>
<p>Brendan has a full report and some screenshots of the Analytics output <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/brendan/entry/unusual_disk_latency">here</a>.</p>
