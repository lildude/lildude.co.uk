<p>Why oh why is Wordpress to pedantic about it's plugins?  I've just spent the past hour scanning code and disactivating/activating plugins trying to work out why when I enable a single plugin, nothing is shown on my site.  The cause - a bloody empty line at the end of said plugin. Why does this matter?</p>
