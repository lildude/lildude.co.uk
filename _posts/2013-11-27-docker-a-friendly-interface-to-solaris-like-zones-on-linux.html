<blockquote cite="https://www.docker.io/">Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.<br />

<p>It's essentially a friendly wrapper around the commands which implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC" target="_blank">Solaris-like zones/containers</a> on Linux.  Given time, and some commitment from some devs and this could be a useful tool for Solaris zones too.</p>
