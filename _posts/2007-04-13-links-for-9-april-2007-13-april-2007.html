<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> - Accepted student applications for Google Summer of Code have been announced! They've accepted over 900 student applicants from a pool of nearly 6,200 applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.deviceforge.com/news/NS9280947932.html">Sun Acquires Java-based Mobile Phone OS</a> - Oooh, maybe Sun will be jumping on the iPhone clone bandwagon.  I doubt it though. I do think we could be seeing some really cool mobile phones and apps coming though.</li>
<li><a href="http://zfs-on-fuse.blogspot.com/index.html">ZFS on FUSE/Linux</a> - OpenSolaris, Solaris, FreeBSD and soon Mac OS X and now even Linux is looking ZFS.  If this a sign of a truely magnificent filesystem?</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/rock_arrived">Rock Has Arrived</a> - Well, it officially exists - Sun's next processor code named Rock.  This is going to be a beasty and will certainly change computing. Check out the two pics on Jonathan's Blog</li>
<li><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9015599&pageNumber=1">Top 10 Firefox Extensions to Avoid</a> - Useful list, and removing the few I had on this list seemed to have improved my browsing experience. Only one more I'd add - Stumbleupon.  If you're using this, you have far too much free time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pidgin.im/index.php?id=177">Gaim is now Pidgin</a> - It seems unbeknown to us all, AOL have been pushing their weight about a bit.  So, to keep them happy, GAIM has been renamed Pidgin.  I'll have to go and change all my compile notes now, but I'll wait for 2.0.0 to be released.</li>
