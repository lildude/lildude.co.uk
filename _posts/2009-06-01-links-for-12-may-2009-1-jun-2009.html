<ul>
<li><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/sst/">Sun Security Toolkit at OpenSolaris.org</a> - The SST (aka JASS) is now open source (under CDDL) and available for OpenSolaris too.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/chrisarmes/entry/parallel_patching_for_solaris_10">Parallel Patching for Solaris 10 - Chris Armes's Weblog</a> - This is a godsend if you've got a system with a lot of zones that needs patching.  You can expect patch for patchadd for this sometime in June so you can get parallel patching before S10u8</li>
<li><a href="http://wikis.sun.com/download/attachments/102400619/community1-whats-new.pdf">What's New in OpenSolaris 2009.06</a> - The presentation slides used by Peter Dennis at Community One</li>
<li><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9133299">Sun seeks to build world's biggest App Store around Java</a> - Now this would be brilliant if Sun manages to pull it off.  It may start off being Windows only to start off with, but as it's Java, there's no good reason it can't become available for OS X, Linux or even OpenSolaris.</li>
