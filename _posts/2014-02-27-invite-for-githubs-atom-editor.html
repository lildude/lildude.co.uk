<p><img class="alignright" alt="Atom Editor" src="/assets/atom.png" width="470" height="330" />Github opened up beta testing to the world for their awesome new editor, <a href="http://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a> and I'm here to offer you an invite.  </p>
<p>I've been using Atom since I started at GitHub and it very quickly replaced Sublime Text (which had already usurped TextMate) as my go-to editor for hacking code. I use it for everything from PHP, Markdown, CSS, Ruby, Javascript and even plaintext (because I can :-) ).</p>
<p>So why would you switch from Sublime Text or TextMate to Atom? Well, because it's much faster in my eyes, but more importantly much easier to customise and enhance.  I know Javascript and CSS/Less and I'm learning CoffeeScript so I have all the skills and tools I need to customise and mould Atom to my tastes.  And if I want to share those with the world, I can package up my enhancements and easily share them with the world.  This is much easier than doing the same thing with Sublime or TextMate.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?  Want and invite? <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@lildude%20Please%20may%20I%20have%20an%20@AtomEditor%20invite" target="_blank">Tweet</a> me your email address and I'll send you an invite.</p>
<p>PS. It's Mac only at the mo, but a Linux and Windows version will be available soon.</p>
