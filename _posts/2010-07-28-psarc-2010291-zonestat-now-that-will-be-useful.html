<p>I've just noticed a new PSARC case, <a href="https://arc.opensolaris.org/caselog/PSARC/2010/291/">PSARC 2010/291: zonestat</a>,  that I know a lot of people will find very very useful. </p>
<p>To quote the summary from the PSARC:</p>
<blockquote><pre>This fast-track proposes the addition of a command line tool to
facilitate the observation of system resources consumed by Solaris
Zones.  The tool is specifically designed to observe the following:

	1.  Memory and cpu utilization of zones.
	2.  Utilization of resource control limits.
	3.  Resource utilization versus physical resources and
	    versus configured limits.
	4.  Various cpu-related resource partitioning schemes,
	    such as processor sets, pools, fair share scheduler,
	    and cpu-caps.
	5.  Total utilization and the per-zone break-down.
	6.  Aggregate, average, and peak utilization over specified
	    time periods.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The PSARC goes on to explain how this would done.  Essentially, it would comprise three components: </p>
<ol>
<li>A zones monitoring daemon: <code>zonestatd(1m)</code> that would run in the global zone and perform monitoring of the system and zones.  It will also respond to queries from the global zone and non-global zones and provide the requested utilisation information.</li>
<li>A private zones monitoring library: <code>libzonestat.so(3lib)</code> that would be used by the CLI component to query the monitoring daemon.</li>
<li>A zones monitoring CLI: <code>zonestat(1)</code> that administrators would use to display zone utilisation information.
<p>The PSARC includes a few usage examples, with this being the one I think most people will be using:</p>
<pre>Example 1: Summary of cpu and memory usage over a 5 second interval:
# zonestat 5 1

<p>Wow! A single simple command to assess the current utilisation of ALL zones on a system. That is going to prove to be extremely useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>The zonestat command would also have the ability to generate machine parseable reports for a definable period of time.  Provided this doesn't have too much of an impact on performance, which I doubt it will, I can see this last usage being used a fair bit by service providers.</p>
<p>Have a read through the details of the <a href="https://arc.opensolaris.org/caselog/PSARC/2010/291/20100726_stephen.lawrence">proposal</a> and then cross your fingers and hope this gets the fast track approval being requested.  This will be a very very useful tool and hopefully we'll see it in the not-too-distant future.</p>
