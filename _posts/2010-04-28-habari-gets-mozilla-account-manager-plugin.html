<p>Wow!!! <a href="https://habariproject.org/en/mozilla-account-manager">This</a> is pretty impressive.  In about two hours, the guys in the <a href="http://habariproject.org/">Habari</a> community whipped up a functioning <a href="http://habariproject.org/dist/plugins/account_manager/">Mozilla Account Manager plugin for Habari</a> so users can now take advantage of the <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/blog/2010/03/account-manager/">Mozilla Account Manager</a> <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/accountmanager/">extension</a> to login/logout of their Habari sites from anywhere on their site (no need to locate the login button/form).  </p>
<p>I believe Habari may have pipped Wordpress to releasing such a plugin too.</p>
