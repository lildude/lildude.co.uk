<p>Looks like Sun is going to be left in limbo for just a little bit longer now.  The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amHPuPBJ.PAc">EU have decided</a> they need to investigate the acquisition in more depth and cite a very good reason...</p>
<blockquote><p>The commission has to examine very carefully the effects on competition in Europe when the world’s leading proprietary database company proposes to take over the world’s leading open source database company</p></blockquote>
<p>This is certainly a very valid point and I'm surprised the US regulators didn't like this part of the deal.  Sadly, it does mean all Sun employees and to a lesser degree shareholders have to now wait until 19 January 2010 at the latest to find out their future.</p>
