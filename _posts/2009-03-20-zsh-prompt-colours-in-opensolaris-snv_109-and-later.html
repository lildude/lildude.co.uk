<p>I've just updated my system to the latest <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com">OpenSolaris</a> release (snv_109) and suddenly my ZSH prompt has lost all it's colours (I use them to clearly distinguish between me and the root user - I'm also a bit of a customisation freak ;-) ).</p>
<p>A little bit of research soon revealed that OpenSolaris snv_109 and later now ships with ZSH 4.3.9 in which they changed the prompt colouring scheme, and for the better too as it's far easier to understand.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
From the ZSHMISC(1) man page:</p>
<pre>
     %F (%f)
          Start (stop) using a different  foreground  colour,  if
          supported by the terminal.  The colour may be specified
          two ways: either as a numeric argument, as  normal,  or
          by  a  sequence in braces following the %F, for example
          %F{red}.  In the latter case the values allowed are  as
          described for the fg zle_highlight attribute; see Char-
          acter  Highlighting  in  zshzle(1).   This  means  that
          numeric colours are allowed in the second format also.
</pre>
<p>So I need to change my PS1/PS2 from using the old <code>$fg[color]</code> format to the new format, which is easy enough.  However I still need my colour prompt to work on pre snv_109 hosts, and this is where ZSH's <code>is-at-least</code> comes in handy.</p>
<p>So, now the code that sets my prompt looks as follows (I've removed the rest of the stuff around it):</p>
<pre><code>if ( is-at-least 4.3.9 ); then
    PS1="%F{magenta}[%(!.%F{red}.%F{blue})%m : %F{green}%40&lt;...&lt;%~%F{magenta}]%F{blue}%(!.#.$) %f"
    PS2="%(!.%F{red}.%F{blue})%_&lt; %f"
else
    PS1="%{${fg[magenta]}%}[%(!.%{${fg[red]}%}.%{${fg[blue]}%})%m : %{${fg[green]}%}\
%40&lt;...&lt;%~%{${fg[magenta]}%}]%{${fg[blue]}%}%(!.#.$) %{${fg[default]}%}" 
    PS2="%(!.%{${fg[red]}%}.%{${fg[blue]}%})%_&lt; %{${fg[default]}%}"
fi</code></pre>
<p>If you're curious, this give me the following prompt for a normal user:</p>
<pre>          <span style="color:magenta;">[</span><span style="color: blue;">devon :</span> <span style="color:green">...data/70478860/ftp-2009-01-07/crash</span><span style="color:magenta;">]</span><span style="color: blue;">$</span></pre>
<p>... and ...</p>
<pre>          <span style="color:magenta;">[</span><span style="color:red;">devon :</span> <span style="color:green;">/usr/bin</span><span style="color:magenta;">]</span><span style="color:blue">#</span></pre>
<p>... for root and as you can see in the first example, it truncates long paths too.</p>
