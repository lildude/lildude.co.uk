<p>Is it just me or has NWAM lost the "M", ie the magic, in snv_135?  I've recently updated and whilst the NWAM functionality has apparently been enhanced (there's way more configuration stuff now) and a more functional GUI implemented, for the life of me I can't get it to reliably connect to my home wifi network.  I need to poke and prod it to come to life on each boot. Time to go digging to see if I can work out why.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This has now been resolved in snv_138 - it was a problem with the WPA svc not being imported.</p>
