<p>Wooohoooo... it looks like Sun Microsystems is <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=the_dot_in_2_0">getting back on track</a> now and back into the driving seat that it rightly deserves.  Sun still made a loss, <a href="http://www.ndtvprofit.com/homepage/storybusinessnew.asp?id=32405&template=&cache=7/26/2006%2010:11:25%20AM">but only under GAAP</a>, which hid the revenue growth of 29%... yes <strong>29%</strong>!!!. If Sun keep this up, Mike Lehman's promise of sustained profitability next year is almost a dead cert. </p>
