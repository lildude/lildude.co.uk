<p><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/13/fish4_goes_down/">Ooops, looks like Fish weren't too happy with a recent failure</a>.  However, in Sun's defence, parts are always sent via a courier and not with the engineer.  I know for certiain, I'd rather the parts be sent to me via a reputable courier than in the back of the field engineer's car.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It would seem the lengthy downtime was entirely Fish's fault - the machine in question is unclustered, they couldn't provide Sun any information about the failure (because they didn't actually use all the functionality of this "very expensive piece of Sun hardware" provides - like a network connection to the SC) and accordingly Sun had to attend site to diagnose the issue.  Now how on earth does Fish think the engineer is going to smell what part he needs without any diagnosis?</p>
