<blockquote cite="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/apr/11/how-the-guardian-uses-github-to-audit-github"><p>Consequently, let’s build a bot to audit the membership of our GitHub organisation. But let’s do away with a backing store, because with a little thought GitHub can be our backing store - and let’s build only the most minimal interface, because GitHub can be our interface too. This means people using our bot need to learn absolutely nothing to use it – they’re devs, and they already know how to use these tools – they already know how to use GitHub.<br />

<p>This is a great idea and a great way to use GitHub to manage your use of GitHub :-)</p>
