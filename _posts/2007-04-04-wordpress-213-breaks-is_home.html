<p>I spent the best part of this morning upgrading Wordpress on this and my personal site.  My personal site upgraded without any problems (that I've noticed), however I encountered problems here.</p>
<p>Firstly, I lost all of my pages.  No idea where they went, but they just disappeared.  Luckily, I only have a few so they were easy to re-create.</p>
<p>The next problem I encountered is with my theme.  It appears that if you call query_posts() within "the loop" (for multiple loops), then is_home() no longer returns TRUE when you're on the home page. This was quickly resolved by implementing one of the other methods for using multiple loops.</p>
<p>Whilst this is fine for me, I think this is a bit of a silly change for non-techie people.  Suddenly their themes are not going to work as they did before, and they're not going to know why. It's also an undocumented change in behaviour.</p>
<p>If you spot any problems, please let me know in the comments.</p>
