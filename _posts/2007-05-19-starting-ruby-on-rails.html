<p>The other day I thought it was about time I actually installed Ruby and see what all the hoolla balloo is with Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>So far, I've installed Ruby, Rails, Mongrel and MySQL successfully following the <a href="http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx">instructions</a> kindly linked off the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> page.  I only encountered one problem along the way in the form of the following error when I attempted to install Rails:</p>
<div class="terminal"><code>$ sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies<br />
Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org<br />
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::GemNotFoundException)<br />
    Could not find rails (> 0) in any repository<br />
$</code></div>
<p>A quick search on Google didn't reveal many hits, but <a href="http://armyofevilrobots.com/node/418">one hit</a> was very useful.  Once I'd followed this tip, all was well and Ruby on Rails was working perfectly on my Mac. </p>
<p>Now it's time to learn some Ruby on Rails and see what everyone is crowing about.</p>
