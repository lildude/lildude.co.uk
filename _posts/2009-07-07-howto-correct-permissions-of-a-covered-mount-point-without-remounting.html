<p>There is a very old bug in Solaris (now fixed in Nevada) in which the underlying permissions of a mount point affect the overlying mounted filesystem.   The normal way to resolve this is to umount the filesystem, correct the permission and remount it.</p>
<p>This is sometime easier said than done, for example, what if one of those filesystems is actually still in use, or even a critical OS filesystem like /var or /etc/mnttab. You don't really want to be umounting these whilst they're in use and the fix may involve booting from network or CD into single user mode.</p>
<p>Well, there is an easier and relatively unknown method of correcting this...</p>
<p><!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Create a temporary directory in which we'll be performing our permissions correcting:
<div class="terminal"># mkdir -m 755 /fixmnt</div>
</li>
<li>Loopback mount the root filesystem onto your new directory using the lesser known "nosub" option:
<div class="terminal"># mount -F lofs -o nosub / /fixmnt</div>
</li>
<li>Correct the permissions of your problem underlying directory, eg /etc/mnttab:
<div class="terminal"># chmod 444 /fixmnt/etc/mnttab</div>
</li>
<li>Umount the temporary loopback mount and remove the temporary directory:
<div class="terminal"># umount /fixmnt<br />
# rmdir /fixmnt</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The permissions on your mount point should now be correct and your desired behaviour should return, all without losing access to the filesystem and without a reboot.</p>
