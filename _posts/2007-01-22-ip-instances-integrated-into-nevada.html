<p>Solaris is another step closer to the complete implementation of <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/">Project Crossbow</a>.  On 19 January, the <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/on/flag-days/pages/2007011902/">IP Instance project was integrated into Nevada</a> with the intentions of making IP Instances available through S10U4.</p>
<p>From the "<a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/Docs/si-interfaces.pdf">IP Instances Interface Document</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>IP instances introduces the ability to have separate zones connected to separate LANs or VLANs without introducing any network security issues. It does this by applying a simple approach to separate all the previously global variables in the TCP/IP collection of kernel modules, so that there can be multiple instances of them, and by providing some extensions to zonecfg to specify that a zone should have its own IP instance.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find more details on  how to configure this is in the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/crossbow/Docs/">Project Crossbow docs</a>.</p>
