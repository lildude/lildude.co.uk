<p>Woohooo!!! Gmail has finally got IMAP support:</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/img/gmail-imap.jpg" alt="Gmail Gets IMAP" title="Gmail Gets IMAP" /></p>
<p>I read about this <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/10/23/gmail-gets-imap/">earlier today</a> and couldn't wait to give it a go.  This is one of the big features I've been waiting for.</p>
<p>Well, so far so good.  Your "Labels" appear a folders and it seems to function as you would expect a normal IMAP server to.</p>
<p>I'll have to give it a while to see how good it is, but so far so good.</p>
