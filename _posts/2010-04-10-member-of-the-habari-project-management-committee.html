<p>Ladies and gentlement, I'm pleased, no delighted, no ecstatic to announce that I have been invited to join the <a href="https://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Cabal">Habari Project Management Committee (PMC)</a>, also known affectionately as the Cabal, with immediate effect.</p>
<p>I'm honoured and flattered to have been considered and invited and have duly accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>A huge thank-you goes to the PMC for their consideration and invitation and I plan to continue making valuable contributions when and where I can.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
