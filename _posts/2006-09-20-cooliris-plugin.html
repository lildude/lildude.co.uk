<p>I stumbled upon this really cool plugin for Firefox (and Safari and IE) - <a href="http://cooliris.com/">Cooliris</a>.  Once installed, the plugin allows you to quickly preview the underlying content of links without actually clicking. Just hover your mouse pointer over a link and see the content immediately (well as immediately as your link will allow the page to be downloaded).</p>
