<p>Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you to a new project of mine... </p>
<p><a href="https://phpsmug.com/"><img class="center" src="/img/phpSmug-logo.png" alt="phpSmug" /></a></p>
<p>phpSmug is a PHP wrapper class for the <a href="https://smugmug.jot.com/WikiHome/API">SmugMug API</a>. The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the SmugMug API in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.</p>
<p><!--more-->phpSmug is written for PHP 4 and PHP 5, however PHP 4 support will be withdrawn at the end of the year when PHP 4 officially reaches the end of life, announced <a href="https://uk.php.net/#2007-07-13-1">here</a>, and then I'll work on optimising this to take full advantage of PHP 5's great features. Don't worry, I will still keep the PHP 4 supporting version available for those who can't move to PHP 5 immediately.</p>
<p>phpSmug is based on the great work of Dan Coulter in <a href="https://www.phpflickr.com">phpFlickr</a>.</p>
<p>I intend on having two concurrently running versions of phpSmug - one for each version of the API versions SmugMug is currently supporting. At the moment, SmugMug are offering 1.2.0 (Stable) and 1.2.1 (Beta).</p>
<p>phpSmug at the moment only supports the 1.2.0 API calls, but I'm in the process of creating a branch for the 1.2.1 API calls.</p>
<p>Now I'll let you in on a little secret - the reason I've created this class is I'm in the process of creating a gallery plugin for Wordpress that draws photos from SmugMug, very much like FAlbum draws photos from Flickr.  To try and keep things simple, I've separated the API interaction code (phpSmug) from the gallery code (to be called SmugGal).</p>
<p>So, if you're a PHP application developer, and need to interact with SmugMug, please feel free to use phpSmug and <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/about">drop me line</a> to let me know what you're up to with this class.</p>
