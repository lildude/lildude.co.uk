<p>You can't make this shit up: Microsoft's Jim Allchin is claiming that Vista's new lockdown features are so capable and thorough that he is comfortable with his own <a href="https://www.betanews.com/article/Allchin_Suggests_Vista_Wont_Need_Antivirus/1163104965">seven-year-old son using Vista without anti-virus software</a> installed.  I wouldn't be so sure - being this cocky is just inviting hackers to find great big holes. Oh and I don't think many 7 year old boys are responsible for large corporate infections.</p>
<div class="update"><strong>Update</strong>: Yeah-but-no-but... It seems <a href="https://www.betanews.com/article/Allchin_Backs_Off_Antivirus_Remarks/1163201739">Jim has changed his mind</a> and Symantec and McAfee won't be going out of business after all.</div>
