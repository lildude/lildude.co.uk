This is great. Sun are advertising <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> in and on buses that serve Redmond (the home of Microsoft for those who don't know) with quotes like the one above and "Stop giving a bully your lunch money".  You can see more of the pictures <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=61801">here</a> or even <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/sunopensource">buy a T-shift</a> for yourself.</p>
<p>Whilst not the most imaginative ad campaign, it certainly is getting people <a href="http://openoffice.blogs.com/openoffice/2006/02/sun_is_marketin.html">blogging about it</a> (me too) and as a result can only have a knock on effect in the uptake of OpenOffice.</p>
<p>So go on, try something different.  <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/2.0.3/index.html">Download</a> and use OpenOffice for a month and see if you can live without MS Office.  I've been MS Office free for about 5 years already and best of all, it's the same program on my Solaris, Ubuntu and Mac machines for no cost at all.</p>
