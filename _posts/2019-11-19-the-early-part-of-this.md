The early part of [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1196557401710837762) brings back so many fond memories & frustrations from when I worked at Sun Microsystems on a SunRay everyday. Peeps often say Sun was so far ahead of the time they couldn’t sell it so I wasn’t expecting the Google Stadia turn.
