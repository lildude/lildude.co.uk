<p>Today...</p>
<blockquote><p>IBM and Sun <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-16-2007/0004646996&EDATE=">announced</a> that IBM will distribute the Solaris operating system (OS) and Solaris Subscriptions for select x86-based IBM System x servers and Blade Center servers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that's got to be an indication of how good Solaris 10 is, and how much demand it's getting now.  This agreement has just effectively opened up Sun's customer base to the entire IBM customer base. Brilliant!!</p>
<p>Now if only Sun had kept up the development on the PowerPC support in Solaris.  IBM may have (in my wildest dreams) extended this agreement to their PowerPC systems too. Now that would have been cool.</p>
