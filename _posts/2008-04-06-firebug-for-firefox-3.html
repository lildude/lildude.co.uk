<p><img src="/assets/firebug-logo.gif" alt="" title="Firebug" width="131" height="125" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-299" /><a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, or the lack there of, WAS the only thing stopping me from using <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers">Firefox 3</a> on a more permanent basis, especially now it's much faster and integrates better on the Mac and given that <a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/04/04/nasty-bug-safari-doesnt-cache-stuff/">Safari seems to be quite selective at what it caches</a>. But not anymore.</p>
<p>With Firebug being such a great tool, I couldn't believe they would take so long to come up with a release that is Firefox 3 compatible, but everytime I fired up Firefox or checked the plugins, there was never a compatible version available.</p>
<p>So instead of relying on the plugin, I thought I'd check out the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> website directly and I'm glad I did.  Just below the big orange "Install Firebug 1.0" button is the link I was looking for... "<a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/releases/firebug/1.1/firebug-1.1.0b12.xpi">Install 1.1 Beta</a>" and a link to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/branches/firebug1.1/docs/ReleaseNotes_1.1.txt">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>A quick scan of the release notes told me everything I wanted to know...</p>

* Supports Firefox 3

<p>A small download and a quick restart later and I had Firebug running in all it's glory on Firefox 3 beta 4. Wooohooo!!!!</p>
<p>I'm still a big fan of Webkit/Safari as I think the Webkit engine is probably a bit better suited to the current internet trends with it's Javascript processing speed, but it's huge caching issue is a bit concerning, and Firefox 3 has come a long way on the Mac now.</p>
