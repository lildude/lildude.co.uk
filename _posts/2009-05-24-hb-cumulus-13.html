<p>I've just pushed out a new revision of <a href="https://github.com/lildude/HB-Cumulus">HB-Cumulus</a>.  This isn't a major update, rather another maintenance update in which I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated tagcloud.swf to that provided with WP-Cumulus 1.20, which includes the following relevant fixes:<br />
	<em>"Fixed the mouse pointer not changing to a hand when hovering tags."</em><br />
	<em>"Adds Turkish language support to the Flash movie."</em></li>
<li>Like the WP-Cumulus plugin, I've also added a "Compatibility" option.  When this is enabled, the plugin will not use the SWFObject Javascript to embed the Flash.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the latest revision from the <a href="https://github.com/lildude/HB-Cumulus">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a new release, I've closed comments on the <a href="/hb-cumulus-12">1.2 post</a>.  If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.3 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
