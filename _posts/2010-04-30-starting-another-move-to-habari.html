<p>Well, it's time I started the slow Wordpress to <a href="http://habariproject.org/">Habari</a> migration process again, this time with my last remaining Wordpress site: <a href="http://lildude.co.uk">lildude.co.uk</a>, aka this one.</p>
<p>I'm now a <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/member-of-the-habari-project-management-committee">member of the PMC</a> and have been "eating my own dog food" ie running other sites on Habari, for quite some time so I really don't have an excuse not to migrate this site across. I could have done it a long time ago, but really didn't have the motivation.  For some strange reason some of that motivation has sprouted from somewhere so I'm starting the process today.</p>
<p>I say process as I'm literally starting from scratch today and as with the <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/migrating-from-wordpress-to-habari/">migration of my personal site</a>, I've got some pedantic desires and ideas that I need to consider and implement as I go along.  So over the next few weeks (hopefully not months) you may notice a few subtle changes around here, but hopefully I won't break anything.  Of course this will also give me some topics to write about as I migrate.</p>
<p>The first change: bye-bye <code>www</code> and trailing slash.</p>
