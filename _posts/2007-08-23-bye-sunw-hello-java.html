<p>As of next week, one of the most actively traded shares on the Nasdaq, will have a new ticker symbol. Sun Microsystems will change it's ticker symbol from SUNW to JAVA.</p>
<p>To quote Jonathan Schwartz...</p>
<blockquote><p>... SUNW represents the past, and its not without a nostalgic nod that we've decided to look ahead.</p>
<p>JAVA is a technology whose value is near infinite to the internet, and a brand that's inseparably a part of Sun (and our profitability). And so next week, we're going to embrace that reality by changing our trading symbol, from SUNW to JAVA. This is a big change for us, capitalizing on the extraordinary affinity our teams have invested to build, introducing Sun to new investors, developers and consumers. Most know Java, few know Sun - we can bring the two one step closer.</p></blockquote>
