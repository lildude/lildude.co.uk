<p>I'm a little late on this one as I've not had a good weekend, but as they say, better late than not at all.</p>
<p>After a very long and winding road (dum dum), the guys finally <a href="https://habariproject.org/en/habari-07-released" target="_blank">pushed out the latest stable release of Habari on Friday</a>.  Yes, this was April fool's day, but this was no hoax; Habari 0.7 has finally seen the light of day. </p>
<p>Full details of what's new can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Release_0.7" target="_blank">release notes</a> and if you're using Habari already, there are some <a href="https://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Upgrading" target="_blank">upgrade details</a> too.</p>
<p>Great work everyone.  Now lets see if we can get 0.8 out the door within a decent time frame ;-)</p>
