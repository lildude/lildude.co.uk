<p>I was reading through <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1841">Derek Sivers'</a> article on why he <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html">switched back to PHP</a> after slogging away are Ruby on Rails for two years, when I stumbled upon something I didn't know and have actually been looking for (though I haven't put much effort into it yet)... autoloading objects in PHP.</p>
<p><!--more-->To my surprise, I've just discovered that PHP 5 introduced just this functionality with the advent of the <code>__autoload()</code> function.</p>
<p>To quote the PHP documentation...</p>
<blockquote><p>
In PHP 5, [...] You may define an __autoload function which is automatically called in case you are trying to use a class which hasn't been defined yet. By calling this function the scripting engine is given a last chance to load the class before PHP fails with an error.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the implementation is pretty simple too.  Once again, drawing from the PHP documentation, you use the function as follows:</p>
<pre lang="php">
          &lt;?php
          function __autoload($class_name) {
              require_once $class_name . '.php';
          }

          $obj  = new MyClass1();
          $obj2 = new MyClass2();
          ?&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Effectively this will attempt to load the MyClass1 and MyClass2 classes from files names MyClass1.php and MyClass2.php respectively.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this function can be further enhanced with additional code, and there are some examples in the notes on the <a href="http://www.php.net/autoload">__autoload() documentation page</a> in the PHP docs.</p>
