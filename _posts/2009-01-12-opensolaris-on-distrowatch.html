<p>There's nothing particularly surprising about seeing <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com">OpenSolaris</a> being mentioned on <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a>, but I did have a random thought: I wonder how high up the "Page Hit Ranking" ranking table we could get OpenSolaris if everyone added a promo link (<a href="http://distrowatch.com/opensolaris">visit OpenSolaris on DistroWatch</a>) to a blog post, and paid a visit themselves.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, OpenSolaris currently has the following rankings:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 days: 32nd</li>
<li>30 days: 29th</li>
<li>3 months: 19th</li>
<li>6 months: 23rd</li>
<li>12 months: 29th</li>
</ul>
<p>I know DistroWatch isn't the be all and end all of OS rankings (it's also a bit of a drab looking site), but it does get a feature in some Linux magazines like <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a> here in the UK and it would be great to see OpenSolaris in the top 10 one month (if not every month).</p>
