<p>Links of interest for 14 Oct 2008 - 1 Nov 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7699873.stm">Multicore Bollocks</a> - Hmmm, for someone who's head of Microsoft Research in Cambridge, he certainly talks a load of old cobblers about multicore CPUs.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/storage/?p=162">Why RAID 5 stops working in 2009</a> - Sounds like there will be more need for ZFS then, that's why Sun are working on some awesome storage products coming to market very soon.  Watch this space.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Murphy/?p=1268">Anatomy of an attack: The New York Times on Solaris</a> - Blowing that NYT and Computerworld article to pieces in an analytical manner.  Good read, regardless of which side of the Linux/Solaris fence you sit.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/erwann/entry/zfs_on_the_desktop_zfs">ZFS Snapshot Visualization in Gnome</a> - Can you say &quot;Time Machine for Solaris&quot;?  This is pretty much what this is, just without the fancy 3D space effect so will actually be more useful in things like simple dev work.</li>
<li><a href="http://directorymanager.wordpress.com/2008/09/26/why-i-like-solaris/">Why I like Solaris</a> - A great write up on a preference for Solaris over Linux.</li>
</ul>
