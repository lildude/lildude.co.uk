<p>I've just pushed <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus</a> 1.4 out the door.  There's no major changes, only a bit of code tidying and I've now also made released a version that is compatible with Habari SVN (which will become 0.7 one day) which uses a new plugin architecture.</p>
<p>Downloads are on the <a href="/projects/hb-cumulus/">HB-Cumulus project page</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a new release, I've closed comments on the <a href="/hb-cumulus-13/">1.3 post</a>.  If you encounter any problems, please ensure you update to rev 1.4 and if the problem still exists, leave a comment here.</p>
