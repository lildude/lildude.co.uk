<p>Look what may be coming to a Solaris release near you. Yes, that's right - <a href="http://research.sun.com/techrep/2006/abstract-156.html">Java device drivers</a>.  This is only a concept and has the potential to mean safer device drivers, it also may mean a dramatic improvement in the performance of Java on Solaris (SPARC in particular), which has always been quite a bit slower than on Linux or Windows.</p>
