<p>I've had enough of the <a href="http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=11710">crap performance</a>, <a href="http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=13442">poor customer service</a>, incompetent technical staff and <a href="http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=13479">childish forum administrators</a> over at Site5, so I've decided to cut my losses and move over to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>.</p>
<p>I think TextDrive will suit my needs more and it's run by a professional team of techies who seem to know how to treat their customers and run a business. And from the look of the forums, it seems most of the customers are technically competent too. There's even an added bonus, <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=11944">everything will be running on Solaris/OpenSolaris</a> soon - even the shared hosting.  Brilliant!!!</p>
<p>I'm impressed with the service already.  I placed my order at about 7pm last night and within an hour I received my confirmation email with my login details.  When I registered with Site5 originally, it took about 8 hours to get a response.</p>
<p>Now to start transferring all my data.</p>
