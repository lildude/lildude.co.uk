<p>Here's a great excerpt from the <a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/os/panic.c#113">panic.c</a> file in Solaris/OpenSolaris:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>    113  *<br />
    114  * A Note on Word Formation, courtesy of the Oxford Guide to English Usage:<br />
    115  *<br />
    116  * Words ending in -c interpose k before suffixes which otherwise would<br />
    117  * indicate a soft c, and thus the verb and adjective forms of 'panic' are<br />
    118  * spelled "panicked", "panicking", and "panicky" respectively.  Use of<br />
    119  * the ill-conceived "panicing" and "panic'd" is discouraged.<br />
</code></p></blockquote>
<p>So remember this next time you're emailing someone about one of your machines "panicing". </p>
