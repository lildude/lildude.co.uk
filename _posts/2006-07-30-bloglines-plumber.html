<p>Just my luck, the weekend I'm working, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> decide they can't keep the damn site up for any reasonable amount of time.  Come on Bloglines, fire your plumber and get some decent redundancy in place. May I suggest a cluster of <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/test/overview_e.jsp?name=E">Sun Fire T2000's</a> - you can try before you buy too.</p>
