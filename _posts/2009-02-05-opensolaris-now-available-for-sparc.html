<p>I've just been catching up on my emails and I noticed something quite exciting that nearly slipped past me on it's way to the trash: <a href="https://opensolaris.com">OpenSolaris</a> is now available for <strong>SPARC</strong>.  </p>
<p>There's only an <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/caiman/auto_install/">Automated Installer</a> image available for SPARC at the moment, but it's still OpenSolaris on SPARC.  Check out the <a href="https://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/indiana-discuss/2009-February/014870.html">announcement</a> for more details.</p>
