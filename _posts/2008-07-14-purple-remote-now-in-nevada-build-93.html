<p>Wooohooo!! purple-remote (used for controlling <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> from the command line) is now in Nevada and works.  For some reason purple-remote wasn't included when Pidgin replaced GAIM on Solaris.  I'm not sure which build it was introduced in, but it's definitely there in build 93. CR <a href="https://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=6578100">6578100</a> still needs to be updated to reflect this though and it still needs to be patched in Solaris 10.</p>
<p>Now I can update my utaction scripts to change my IM status whenever I pull my Java card from the Sunray DTU, like I used to do when I used GAIM.</p>
