<p>Links of interest for 1 Jul 2008 - 30 Jul 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/levon/entry/direct_mounting_of_files">Direct Mounting of Files</a> - As of snv_91, you no longer need lofi to mount a filesystem image, like an ISO. You can now call mount(1M) as you would a normal filesystem.</li>
<li><a href="https://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/ip+Provider">DTrace IP Provider</a> - Cool.  The first step of implementing TCP/IP DTrace providers in Solaris has made it's way into snv_93.</li>
<li><a href="https://elektronkind.org/2008/07/opensolaris-2008-11-storage">OpenSolaris 2008.11 - A Preview For The Storage Admin</a> - A great review of the features you can find in OpenSolaris 2008.11 from a Storage perspective, ie the stuff sysadmins want, but the other reviews never mention.</li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.sun.com/dillon/entry/netapp_draft">NetApp Litigation  - an update</a> - Just in case you haven't seen it yet. Looks like several of the patents NetApp rely on in their WAFL filesystem are open for scrutiny again and one has already been struck from the litigation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/spring/bp/2008/1?sortBy=rank&amp;order=asc">100 Best Places to Work in IT 2008</a> - Interesting list, but I'd take it with a pinch of salt.  Sun are on the list (14th), but none of the other big IT corps like MS, IBM, Dell or Apple are.</li>
</ul>
