<blockquote cite="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/howto-svcbundle-manifest-profile-1866525.html">With the introduction of svcbundle in Oracle Solaris 11.1, the creation of manifests and profiles is even easier, allowing you to take advantage of the benefits of automatic application restart without requiring you to have full knowledge of the XML file format that is used when integrating with the Service Management Facility (SMF).<br />

<p>Wooohooo!!! Finally, a quick and simple method of creating SMF Manifests and profiles.  No you have absolutely NO excuse for not converting any of your old RC scripts to SMF.</p>
