<p>I'm quite excited about the recent news of <a href="https://biz.yahoo.com/bw/081210/20081210005369.html?.v=1">Toshiba's agreement to ship OpenSolaris.</a> This can only help expand the usage of OpenSolaris in the business community with Toshiba being one of the laptops of choice in this market.</p>
<p>One thing I really hope that is implemented into OpenSolaris is the tablet functionality, specifically the screen rotate and handwriting recognition functionality that I'm using to write this post - I've just discovered this whilst playing with the wife's Toshiba laptop (sadly running Windows Vista) and I think this is really cool and definitely something I'd love to see is OpenSolaris.</p>
<p>I have no idea what tablet support there is in Linux, but I suspect it's a lot more than there is in OpenSolaris. I hope this changes PDQ.</p>
