<p>How would you like to run Solaris, Windows or even Linux on your iPad?  I know, it's sad and geeky and you probably don't want to, however sometimes you need to do real work for a short period of time with what resources are at hand, namely your iPad.</p>
<p>Well, if this demo of the "Oracle Virtual Desktop Client 3.0 ... the iPad Edition" (aka Sunray client software) actually becomes to fruition as an official product, you'll be able to do just that...</p>

<p>Now this is pretty impressive and if it ever comes to fruition, it may just be the one thing that sways me to buying an iPad... of course being able to expense it would be even better.</p>
