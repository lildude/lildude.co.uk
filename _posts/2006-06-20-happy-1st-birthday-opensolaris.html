<p>One year on and still going strong.  If you've got a spare partition or machine and are just the least bit curious about the best OS in the world, then <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/downloads/">download</a> it and give it a go.</p>
<p>There's a great community, and discussion aliases full of Sun people, so if you have a problem or query, you're likely to get the answer from someone in the know.  Now can you same the same thing about other operating systems?</p>
