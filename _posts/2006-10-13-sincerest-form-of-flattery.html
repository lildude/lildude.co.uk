<p>Novell and Red Hat have <a href="https://news.zdnet.com/2100-9589_22-6108272.html?tag=nl.e589">concrete plans to build</a> "container" virtualization into their Linux products. They're already working on Xen, but now they like the idea of presenting a single OS as many using "containers", thus reducing the overhead and increasing performance.  Hmmm, this sounds remarkably <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zones/">familiar</a>.</p>
