<p>Some people have far too much time... some guy has decided, just for the hell of it, to <a href="http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/12/06/cybernotes-200-firefox-extensions-installed-at-one-time/">install 200 Firefox extensions</a>, all at once, to see what would happen. I'm impressed Firefox managed to actually start, however I doubt it would have stayed up very long. </p>
