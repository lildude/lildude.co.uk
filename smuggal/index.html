<p>SmugGal is a PHP Class that allows you to add a gallery of your SmugMug pictures, to any website.</p>
<p>SmugGal is intended to integrate into your website without the need for extensive styling. Accordingly, a very minimalist stylesheet is provided.</p>
<p>SmugGal also takes advantage of Thickbox (http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/) functionality, if you wish.  It gracefully degrades if Javascript is not enabled in the user's browser.</p>
<p>So far there are two variants available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standalone SmugGal, for use on any website.</li>
<li>As a Wordpress plugin, for integration into your Wordpress site.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only difference between the two is the additional files supplied within the archives. If you downloaded the Standalone version, you won't have the Wordpress specific files, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>SmugGal uses the latest <a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/phpsmug/">phpSmug</a> wrapper class.</p>
<div class="alert">
<strong>IMPORTANT:: IMPORTANT</strong> </p>
<p>In order for SmugGal to display your images, they need to be externally viewable/linkable from SmugMug.  Please ensure "ext. links" within SmugMug is set to true for those galleries you wish to show on your website.  If you don't, you won't see any pictures.</p></div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>SmugGal is easy to install, configure and setup.  You can have your SmugMug images in a gallery format on your website in next to no time.</li>
<li>SmugGal attempts to integrate into your website with the least amount of effort by using very generic styling.  Accordingly, only a small amount of additional CSS styling may be required in order to get SmugGal integrated perfectly into your site.</li>
<li>Thickbox (http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/) functionality can be enabled or disabled, depending on your needs. If enabled, it gracefully degrades if Javascript is not enabled in the user's browser.</li>
<li>SmugGal displays "unlisted" galleries, without changing any settings in your SmugMug settings. If you don't want to show these galleries, you don't have to.</li>
<li>SmugGal displays your image descriptions as they appear in SmugMug.</li>
</ul>
