<p><a href="http://lildude.co.uk/projects/hb-audio-player/">HB Audio Player</a> is a highly configurable but simple Flash based MP3 player for all your audio needs. You can customise the player's colour scheme to match your blog theme, have it automatically show track information from the encoded ID3 tags and more.</p>

<p>That's it. You're ready to start using the audio player on your site.</p>
<h2>Upgrade</h2>
<p>The upgrade procedure is as per the installation procedure, but please ensure you de-activate the plugin first.  This will ensure your current settings are merged with any new options that may be added with later releases.</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>The default mechanism for inserting a player in a post is to use the <code>[audio]</code> syntax:</p>
<pre>	[audio:http://www.yourdomain.com/path/to/your_mp3_file.mp3]</pre>
<p>This will insert a player and load <code>your_mp3_file.mp3</code> into it.</p>
<p>Multiple file can be specified by separating their paths/names with commas.</p>
<p>You can configure HB Audio Player with a default audio files location so you don't have to specify the full URL everytime.  You can set this location via the Configuration panel. Once set, you can use this syntax:</p>
<pre>	[audio:your_mp3_file.mp3]</pre>
<p>HB Audio Player will automatically look for the file in your default audio files location. This can be very handy if you decide to move all your audio files to a different location in the future.</p>
<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<p>By default, HB Audio Player gets the track information from the ID3 tags of the MP3 file, however under some circumstances it won't be able to, for example if the file is on another domain.  This is a restriction of the Flash player, but it can be over-ridden.</p>
<p>You can however pass the artist and title information when inserting the player using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>	[audio:your_mp3_file.mp3|titles=The title|artists=The artist]</pre>
<p>For multiple files:</p>
<pre>	[audio:mp3_file_1.mp3,mp3_file_2.mp3|titles=Title 1,Title 2|artists=Artist 1,Artist 2]</pre>
